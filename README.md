# YouTube Summarization with T5 Pre-trained Transformer

This project aims to summarize YouTube videos using the T5 pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face. It utilizes the YouTube Transcript API and NLP libraries to fetch the video transcript, clean it up, and generate a concise summary.

 ## Usage
1. Provide the YouTube video link you want to summarize:
```bash
link = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your-video-id"
```
2. Run the code and the summary will be generated.

## Acknowledgments
- Hugging Face for providing the T5 pre-trained transformer model.
- YouTube Transcript API for retrieving YouTube video transcripts.
- NLTK for natural language processing capabilities.
