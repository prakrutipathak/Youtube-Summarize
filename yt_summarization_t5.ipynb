testig their meus ad so I thik someoe eeds to go ad create a b testig software that restaurats ca igest super easily [Music] what's up Steph Steph is back uh back i the house oe of the most requested retur guests of all time um we should have you o more what are you doig ow by the way you uh you left the hustle slash HubSpot you wet to Adreesse is that where you're at still are you doig other thigs yeah exactly I'm at a16z I'm their ew podcast host so they've had a podcast for like seve or eight years ad the it wet o Hiatus they looked for a ew host ad that's me we have't goe live yet but we will be soo every time you come o you brig this like documet that's basically like it's sort of what me ad Sam do but whe me ad Sam do a episode we have like two or three bullet poits each like three words ad I have two ad he has two ad that's how we prepare you sed this like Ecyclopedia Britaica of topics ideas like half fake thigs i your head um so like I'm lookig at this this is like seve or eight pages or somethig like that oh o 12 pages log so um we have a lot to choose from so where do you wat to start I wated to share this oe idea I thik I've actually talked about it o aother couple pods but with the pademic a buch of restaurats have goe olie quote uquote they have the QR codes right ad you pull up the meu some restaurats have reverted back to the physical meu but tos of restaurats are still usig these QR codes ad somethig that I thik of every sigle time as a iteret marketer is why they are ot a b testig their meus ad so I thik someoe eeds to go ad create a b testig software that restaurats ca igest super easily ad the basis of this is well a if you thik about what has made so may iteret compaies successful it is the fact that they have these alterate worlds that they ca a B test right Google home page are we usig this fot or this fot I'm usig this color this color Netflix you kow Amazo every all of these large iteret compaies have used this but also there's the restaurat equivalet so the hustle did a story o this woma Michelle baesh ad you ca just look up desig restaurat meus the hustle or somethig like that to get the article but we wrote about this woma who her job was literally to go redesig meus physical meus ad based o her uderstadig of huma psychology orietatio there's like this Zed or Z effect o the meu ad the way people scroll she was able to figure out how to get oe restaurat just as a example to brig i ie dollars more per customer by redesigig their meu same products but just the orietatio the order of the meu the desig of it ad I was thikig why are't restaurats ot usig this as i ow we have the QR code which allows us to direct someoe to ay uique lik right we have the digitizatio of this ad so you could hire someoe like Michelle ad she could probably figure out how to do this for you or someoe should be just create a software that allows restaurats to do this they do't eed to chage their meu at all but they ca mess aroud with the meu desig the same way you mess aroud with ladig page desig ad get higher coversio ad of course the average restaurat ower is ot goig to kow how to do this ad that's why I thik there eeds to be just some sort of software that says hey we ca icrease your coversios right by 50 we ca icrease your average customer value by three dollars whatever it is ad I I have't see it aywhere this is amazig um this is great I remember so I started a restaurat back i the day my very first startup was a restaurat ad we were but whe we fially got to lauch log story short we were like um do we wat to lauch a physical restaurat we got to sig this 10-year lease with a persoal guaratee that souds scary ad our Metor kid of was like could you test your cocept by doig delivery oly ad basically it was like a cloud what a cloud kitche is today but this was back you kow more tha 10 years ago ow where there was o doordash there was o ubereats at the time but it was like What If people could just order olie what if you just had a kitche earby dowtow there was o physical seatig there's o there's o storefrot you just deliver ad we were like uh okay liste so we tried it ad whe you do that you're really coscious of well our whole meu is olie so that meas we could ru a test to just see like what makes people order more or ot ad so we did the most basic of a B test the first thig we did was we were tryig to lower prices ad we talked to this guy Da ariely who was um he wrote this book predictably irratioal ad we were like Da uh hey we're you kow three dudes tryig to build this like sushi restaurat startup you kow um do you kow aythig about the restaurat idustry ad he's like I kow a lot about the restaurat idustry he goes I get paid by compaies to come i ad help them with either the meu or like he told us about some experimet I thik Pada Express had paid him a buch of moey to do to basically say could we get people we have healthy items o the meu ad people tell us the reaso they do't eat here is because it's uhealthy but obody orders the healthy items so like what gives ad he's like oh humas are predictably irratioal they'll tell you oe thig ad the they wo't do it ad he the oe test he had made was whe you walk ito a Pada Express istead of puttig both items o the meu ad just havig you choose it was right whe you walked through the door it would say there was like a little agel path it's like if you're goa eat healthy go this way ad there was like the dev you're goig to eat idulgetly you kow like if you wat full flavor go this way ad whe people make that choice upo walkig i ad the they oly see a meu of those items like they were happier with their choice ad they ordered more of those items ad so he like figured out that was the oly way he could desig this restaurat to do that oe thig um ad so similarly he was like oh he goes oh yeah I ca help your busiess your prices are too low ad we go what do you mea like everybody says Sushi's too expesive we're tryig to make it more affordable like how is that a bad thig well you kow like what are you talkig about ma we're tryig to do the people's work here he's like he's like sushi uh people like do you ever wat to if I told you you ca eat cheap sushi would you wat that ad he's like o ad he's like you kow he's like so just like the you kow wie idustry uh people buy expesive thigs because it makes them feel good that they bought a higher quality thig so he goes just test the price so we did it we basically upped the price 50 o oe meu versus the other we just a b tested it ad we had like higher coversio rate o the higher price which is crazy um like ot eve just it etted more moey it was higher coversio rate o the higher price so that was like the first time I saw this like meu a b testig I mea thik about how big of a lift that is like if you ca covert every customer at a higher rate at a higher dollar amout that's like you kow meaigful i a idustry that's like 10 margis ad so we did that the we tested other thigs like uh istead of just sayig you kow this is a whatever this is like the Philadelphia roll we use salmo it's like Alaska salmo had caught Alaska ciamo farm caught had had you kow hadled Alaska salmo or whatever we just started addig all these extra words that were like othig chage othig they were all true but it's like always fresh ever Froze Alaska salmo had caught by a farmer ear you ad it's like oh people like love that ad the they would buy more ad so you could see these little meu tricks ow what I did't thik of which is your your geius idea is how do you actually tur that ito a busiess where you could become a agecy that does this for compaies you could become a piece of software that does this as AV testig of QR codes um you could do this with physical meus also by the way like you could just give out two differet versios of the physical meu ad say ad just track the tickets ad be like cool we kow what the what the checkout is for both um for how much they sped o both sides ad we ca just prove to you that meu desig a is better tha b ad like you kow your curret meu was desiged by like your iece who kows Photoshop so like you kow I thik we ca do better tha that ad if we do that if we beat your curret meu the you pay us you kow 50 a moth ad we'll keep ruig tests for you yeah I thik this is actually a really really great idea yeah I thik the key differece I mea you always look for iflectio poits I thik you guys say or chages ad so before you're right you could do this with physical meus but you kow the data is so much harder to get ad you have to like match up the physical meu with the POs software you're usig but ow I do't kow what the percetage is but we all kow a to of restaurats are usig these QR codes ad so they're already they've like take the major step that they wet before of digitizig the experiece ad so ow what you eed to do is just apply those aalytics ad so some compay eeds to just go create the software ideally it itegrates ito the POS so you just literally ca pop out a report at the ed but eve if you do't have it itegratig with the POs I thik you ca eve just like look at oh how log does someoe sped o this meu versus this meu how are they scrollig yeah what items are beig sold I do't thik you would eve eed to because you're basically so basically they'll sca the QR code ad it's like you kow Google optimize or optimizig oe of those they'll eter a ABS exactly ad the you're goa pass the the fial value Here's the fial cart that they're checkig out with to the you kow to to the thig ad whe it's i perso uh like i restaurat like they check out uh with everythig you kow they do't they do't like they do't walk away you kow they actually do order food so you ca kid of like bet pretty heavily o that I woder if people would also do this with uh doordash or ubereats like yeah could I be a service that just optimizes your doordash listig with photos meus copy ad like if you're a atioal chai that's i like you kow whatever thousad cities ad I ca get you a extra half a poit coversio or extra two dollar you kow cart size that's pretty meaigful for for these uh you kow these restaurats that are o o these delivery platforms yeah I was thikig about that too because ubereats meus are always so log ad you kow there's like that what's it called where you have too may optios um paralysis by aalysis or whatever exactly exactly yeah ad also ubereats will have three or so items at the top of like our most popular items ad I do't kow if Uber actually selects that for the restaurat but if you had the optio ad actually if you're a egieer at Uber workig o this like create a platform where people ca a B test right o ubereats so that they feel like that's a platform where they're makig more moey versus doordash versus their ow like that's a value add passed if someoe created their ow olie meu that people ordered from uh which would make obviously more sticky for people to stay there well I looked at the startup that was I kow this works because I looked at the startup I was doig exactly this what they were doig was they would go to a local mom-ad-pop restaurat that was like let's say Chiese food they'd say great you kow Mr Has Chiese you kow great you're you're everybody loves you locally ad ow you're o doordash but like your photos are kid of crap your you kow your descriptios are all off you're ot sayig what foods are vega eve though they are vega you're just you do't list them um like you're just ot optimized so what he would do is he would parter with the restaurat ad he would just create a shadow like a like a cloe of the brad but he would call it like you kow um like choo choo Chiese like it would be like a more like catchy ame the all the photos are super bright um so it's like you kow o a backdrop of like orage or red or whatever ad like really good lookig photos ad they would trim the meu dow he'd be like look people come i here they wat like fried chicke ad they wat dumpligs ad they wat this ad that ad so he would just do like this is just these items um he wrote better copy he took better photos ad the all it was was whe a order gets placed o those restaurats that same restaurat just gets a ticket they do't eve it's like they do't eve kow it's like from this other brad basically ad the later they would sed them packagig that's like hey if it comes i through this Regis this like uh ticket priter um put it i the choo choo Chiese like box do't put it i Mr Has like you kow like local box um ad so they just create a separate packagig so he's like yeah we have 200 restaurats we do like you kow 17 millio i gmv ad we operate oe of these restaurats they were already restaurats that already existed all we did was just Rebrad them for Postmates ad ubereats ad doordash ad I was like oh my God like this is like a mid-blowig idea that yeah actually works he's like yeah they love it because they get like 30 extra Reveue just because we're better at marketig o those platforms tha they are ad um I woder how they do it ow I actually have't caught up with them I did't I did't ed up ivestig because I was like I do't kow where this goes like this I feel like this could just get like baed or blocked i oe secod but like uh it was a fasciatig idea ad that guy was really taleted who was doig it yeah uh oe more thig o the idea of food have you see that I thik it's the FDA their food pyramid or at least i Caada that's what we called it the food pyramid ad you have like all these grais ad they're like eat this much bread ad ad they're rethikig that have you see that they're they're really well they should right carbs the foudatio like fruit was this time fruit ad vegetables were this like they shared a little sectio like they had buk beds at the top of the pyramid it was crazy yeah they were uh you kow people got upset because I mea a simple example is they'd be like uts o uts too much fat ad the they'd be like butt white bread okay you kow they're foudatioal ad so uh they're comig out with a ew food pyramid of sorts ad that impacts I did't kow this but foods ca uh apply the word healthy to their products like you kow Brads you could like actually have the word healthy o your cereal box as a example based o this food pyramid or some sort of requisites ad they're chagig that ad I just thought I do't kow if there's a busiess idea here but I feel like there's goig to be a to of cotet a to of chages comig out because of this because I mea the food pyramid was pretty foudatioal ad so I do't kow what the busiess idea here is but it's just like oe of those uh there's there's got to be somethig here well that's a good iflectio I'll give you aother iflectio like that that I was thikig about over the weeked um so you kow like the law chage that allows College athletes to moetize their brad or face called il ame ad like this ad um so that came ito effect this year ad so ow ow College athletes ca get paid for example whe we did our MFM camp we paid uh puff Johso this basketball player at North Carolia to come like drop i ad play pickup with us it was just a cool momet it's like oh yeah here's like this guy who's goa be i the NBA i a couple years like he's just he's just playig with us ad we paid him I do't eve kow what like 200 or somethig like that to show up for for a hour ad he's like cool like I got othig else goig o o a Saturday like I'll go pick up 200 bucks ad by the way he was a awesome guy um so that's a little like Market that's gotte created I was like I was askig Be I was like how did you book him like what'd you use ad he's like I just dm'd him o Istagram ad I was like oh iterestig there's o there's ot really a great Marketplace yet that's coectig College athletes to the like people who wat to pay them for their you kow just to to do a appearace or a sposorship whatever there's some people tryig but obody's like do't kow there's goig to be oe compay that just ows this here's the liquidity it's like we got all the athletes ad the like because of that we got all the brads ad we take care of all the trasactios ad you do't eed to use Istagram DMS ad like vemo like it just all happes to your platform ad we have all the reportig that we had over to the uiversities so I thik that's like a big idea is like create Agel list for like you kow the il Marketplace the secod thig is just what opportuities does this ope up so Dave Portoy who rus Barstool they jumped o this pretty early they're like oh great we'll have a Barstool athlete program where you ca sig up to be a Barstool athlete which will help you get these deals ad uh they came out they're like we're takig zero percet cut o these deals I do't kow how or why but they just decided to say that ad um ad he's like we have 200 000 College athletes as part of this ow some some like huge umber like that that's isae so I was thikig I was like ma so may differet products ad brads have bee built off ifluecer marketig everythig from you kow movemet watches which were like early to Istagram like ifluecer marketig ad built 100 millio dollar watch brad um you kow Sugar Bear Hair you kow they got the Kardashias to be take pictures with this gummy you kow bitig this little blue gummy ad that became like this icoic look ad the that became like agai 100 millio dollar like you kow uh supplemets brad ad so ow I'm thikig well all of a sudde overight you ow ca tap ito the ifluecer marketig of college athletes across the coutry ad probably very few brads are doig this just yet ad you could almost create a compay just workig backwards from all right if I could get every ifluetial College athlete to post somethig what product should I make that's goig to work best with their audiece ad like their trust ad all that stuff because it's kid of a usaturated marketig chael right ow i a usaturated marketig chael right ow is like worth it ca be worth like 100 millio dollars if you ca if you ca be the first to figure it out that debt platform ad so you could kid of thik about what products would Their audiece buy because ow I ca reach them for a very low cost ad they this could't this literally could't happe before so you have this iflectio chage ad so I thik that's aother like braistorm that somebody could do ad figure out what product would fit that category ad just work backwards from the distributio what would you do do you have ay thoughts o if you were to choose that as your Chael people talk about like Chael Market but what what product would you create well so so thikig o the Eco like kid of the e-commerce side just for a secod so I was like all right you ca uh ad I do't kow if eCommerce is the best like I thik probably like some credit card or debit card or somethig like that is probably the best like if you could basically go get you kow um a millio people A millio college studets to start usig your credit card because you got you kow 100 000 athletes to just say like oh I'm usig this ad sig up for this bous Poit program ad you get a you kow whatever 500 credit for sprig break or whatever I do't kow you could come up with some offer but you distribute it through these athletes ad you basically say cool if I if I get at age 18 to 21 somebody to pick my credit card what's that Worth to me um ad I thik that's probably like you kow oe of the best categories you could be i but if it's ot that let's just take e-commerce for a secod like I thik that you wat the you fid that you would first go to the class of the best e-commerce products to like high purchase rate high like kid of lock-i basically high margi um you kow low shippig why like ative deodorat was such a great product it weighed less tha a poud so you could ship it i a ormal evelope so shippig was low cost it's repurchased because you wear deodorat every day ad you ru out of it every whatever two three moths ad so you're goa keep buyig i um it's high margi like it oly costs this much to make ad they could charge whatever 20 bucks to to sell a two pack ad so like it had a lot of the traits that make for a great product ad so I would try to figure out like whether it's like protei powder or like athletic grees or you kow like some you kow like sparklig water brad or like you kow some Seltzer smelly water oh yeah smelly water I try to figure out some product like that that's like Mass Appeal high margi High repeat purchase rate ad the I would just like work backwards from that ad I would't do you kow products that are like you kow big oe-off purchases with the low repurchase I just try to stay away from those so I would go look at the wiers of like curret e-commerce ad the I would try to you kow retrofit those ad be like would that like particularly hit with a um a college groud like I thik like a eergy drik would be like amazig uh like I thik I thik if you could do like you kow whatever Red Bull rock star type of thig is if you could just make like the ext the ext either you kow um vitami water or or eergy drik I thik that's probably the the strogest oe but if it's ot that the some kid of like subscriptio product like maybe deodorat or um I do't kow somethig like that this is probably where I'd go for it deodorat would work you ca be like do't smell o the court or some you kow cheesy thig like that but yeah I thik deodorat would actually be well you could also like just if it's like just riffig o that you could take the deodorat Brads ad you could like make it specific you could make the sese specific to the to the campus so like you kow whatever whatever the ame like you kow you have like Loghor you kow whatever for UT ad the you have like the ames of the scets that like kid of fit that market it's the same scet you're just labelig it differetly depedig o where it's at but you're ow pullig ito that kid of like brad Affiity they already have with their with their campus or whatever else ad it makes sese for the athlete to be promotig that because it's like agai they're like a college athlete for that school maybe you could do some thigs like that to like juice how um you kow how attractive it is I kid of love that because I I'm just you kow my marketig hat is o ad there's so may taglies you could be like siff out your competitors or like you kow you you could imagie these iteret Wars of like oh ma that like that Uiversity is set sucks or that like high school like have you smelt that like that that stuff's asty or like you kow people actually competig o which which college has you kow for every every stick that's bought here we you kow drop oe stik bomb at your rival school like that's like some some way to like you kow compete with the other schools ice I ca't fid this cliet ifo have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every applicatio every team ca stay aliged o out of syc spreadsheets or duelig databases HubSpot grow better okay let's do a quick oe which is I actually saw this i the treds ewsletter a while ago I did't write this but um it was the stat which is the average perso speds oe ad a half thousad dollars after a breakup I have o idea where the stack came from but defiitely got the wheel spiig ad they came up with a buch of differet ideas which I thik actually are gettig some tractio divorce party ideas is somethig that gets search volume breakup cake um people throwig their ow breakup parties ad I was just like huh I do't kow if there's you kow specific brads that are takig this o but I was like huh that that's that oe ad a half thousad dollars do't kow where it came from but there's somethig there that's like if I'm if I'm F Jerry you kow that like Istagram accout ad they have these like they built a kid of like a little media Empire they have a buch of other accouts but they also have products they make like they made that that card game I thik they they make some products yeah if I was if I was oe of those accouts I would be jumpig o this I would basically say all right it's already viral it's meme worthy it's it's remarkable people are goa talk about this so how do I make you kow like the best breakup cake delivery service or yes um you kow like uh the Revege body kit ad it's like you kow we sed you this like the seve day detox um where you said you're like a healig Crystal we sed you like a juice clease ad whatever else to like you kow get that perso out of your out of your life so you're goa get the bad juju you kow away ad I'd be like you kow this is called bad juju or whatever ad I would just try to create like a viral product through that um because I thik it's o brad ad I thik it has like eough demad where there's you could see this doig you kow two to te millio dollars a year all orgaic yeah just because the product is so viral um you kow it's probably ot goig to be eormous but there's a there's eough of a iche there especially if you're oe of these accouts because you already got distributio or you're somebody who goes to those accouts ad parters with them ad says hey I got the right product for you guys let's do you kow some kid of profit share ad I'll ru this busiess ad you guys just help me promote this like you kow uh whatever like the breakup vodka ad it's like you kow this is the break of vodka kit or whatever you kow whatever the thig is yeah I mea I'm imagiig you kow all the tropes of someoe gets broke up with ad they become super fit ad like they get a PhD ad they just become like the best versio of themselves after the breakup does't always happe but you could imagie somethig like that eve less work it's like what's those what are those like voodoo dolls where you like poke it ad you're like you kow you're just sedig like ill will towards them you could just like upload a photo of your perso we prit you a doll that looks like you kow like close eough like them ad like you ca do that that remids me of did you see that startup empty it was fake did you did you hear about this it's I thik it was you kow it had the silly spellig to it was like e-m-p-t-i or somethig ad it was a fake startup that people thought was real ad basically they set people these empty boxes um ad the whole idea was like look we sed you these empty boxes ad there's some like motivatioal quote from Buddha i it ad it's like you kow rid yourself of all the thigs you do't eed i your life ad the idea is that people are supposed to take all their juk put it i these boxes ad sed it to this compay for free but they pay this compay to sed them these boxes um but it was a fake startup ad all these people are writig about it they're like oh this is so smart like what a cool compay yeah exactly it was a joke but yeah actually you could do that with this too you could sed them the breakup box it's like put all their crap i this all their crap they've left i your house that remids you of them put it i this sed it to us ad we will sed you a video of us like burig this box i this like epic way ad like you get to have that at the ed that's it those are the types of ideas you could do with this ice so you were right before we started reportig you were startig to tell me you go here's my theory of why people like this podcast ad what is your theory okay so there are may reasos to love my first millio I thik there's somethig that you guys have doe especially recetly whe you ad Sam just go back ad forth ad you tell a really fuy joke ad the Sam just starts laughig hysterically like i a cotagious way that most people would hold back maybe o a podcast but it's it's literally as people say like you're i the room with him ad it remided me of this subreddit I foud recetly called r slash cotagious laughter 4.5 millio people subscribe to this ad it's oe of I thik the top hudreds subreddits out there ad it's literally just a feed of people laughig ad there's there's dozes of posts every day ad I I was just as I wet dow it I was like there's gotta be a post of Sam ad Sea well okay let me tell you a couple iterestig thigs about this first I thik this must I thik the subreddit must be kid of like almost like ew or growig faster recetly right because I had't heard of this subreddit before ad I kid of keep a eye o o the top oes but maybe I just missed it but I I've also see this tred o Tick Tock I do't kow if you've see it somebody will be like I'm a cliical psychologist ad I ca make you happier i the ext 10 secods repeat after me huh ad there's like a duet so that guy's like hot excuse like haha ad you're just like okay I see where this is goig ad the she just gets like haha ad like by the ed both people are just crackig up like because it's like 10 Deep ad uh you ca't help yourself like the body will just start like geuiely laughig just from makig the soud like it goes both ways it's ot like somethig fuy happes therefore I break out laughig it's like if you break out laughig itetioally you could just like it could it's like somethig fuy just happeed basically ad um yeah ad so I've thought about this like cotagious laughter thig i two ways oe is as if I was thikig about the podcast ad I was like I was watchig I was watchig the all lad pod ad um I love that podcast but they do somethig that really bothers me which is oe of them will crack a joke ad the other guys do't what I call Selva joke like they do't laugh um ad I do't kow if they do't laugh because they're tryig to they're a they do't thik it's fuy B it's ot that they're tryig to keep it serious or see they might just edit it where they just do't use the audio track from someoe because it kid of makes it a little choppy because you're usig oe o top of the other but it totally chages the vibe of somethig whe um i a podcast especially whe the other perso actually sells your joke like if you if you try to crack somethig ad I go with it or ad this works for for other thigs o my first millio too I call it the homie move where Sam would be like do you kow how may people buy this thig ad I kow it's probably a high umber if he's tellig me like that but I'll be like I do't kow what like like 100 ad just to give them they're like o dude a millio ad like I give them that like assist basically ad so there are several thigs like that where you got to kid of sell the other perso's thig ad it's ot fake it's just like be expressive like laugh hard react big that stuff works whe it comes to cotet ad people are very shelled up about that sort of thig um I do't kow if that that is i lie with what you're talkig about totally oe of the fuiest momets o my first millio was your Orlado Bloom story which I thik if I just heard you tellig it by yourself I'd be like yeah that's pretty fuy but Sam's laughter layered oto that where he was you could just tell he was dyig as you were tellig that story just made it hoestly top five momets o my first millio history for me but that's why I thik this subreddit is so great eve i their rules or their like Commuity guidelies you kow how someoe posts somethig ad there's typically a bot that says hey report this if X Y ad Z o that subreddit it's like report this if you're laughig at a joke or some sort of icidet ad ot the laughter specifically they're like we oly wat you to be o here to hear other people laughig so I do't kow I just thought that was like a fu a fu thig ad remided me of why I thik some people love my first millio it's just so authetic well you're you're about to do a podcast ad do you remember what I told you my advice to you whe it came to to doig a podcast I do't kow if you remember this this is a couple years ago ow I actually do't you should tell me I was like um do't be too ormal or I was like you're too ormal I was like you eed to be um yeah like to me the ideal podcast guest is like half isae um ad what that meas is like there's thigs that they're ot eve aware of that are iside like Sam has a to of these where he's like dude I was thikig you kow you kow you thik about like what happes if someoe broke right behid me right ow ad tried to kill me I'm like o I do't thik that the fact that you thik I thik that meas you're kid of isae like you're ot eve aware of that that's a weird thig you're doig you thik that other people do that too ad the the secod is like beig willig to say somethig crazy stuff like that uh ad the the third is like they do't hedge um ad like try to dowplay like most people are basically takig their ow little volume kob ad turig it dow all the time just because they wat to fit i ad so the best thig you could do if you wat to be a persoality o the Iteret is like you ca't have that I'm tryig to fit i tur the volume dow thig you gotta like tur it up if aythig um ad so that was my theory o it ow I do thik I might be wrog because like there's people like Lex Friedma or whoever who are successful with their podcast ad like you kow it's like you kow Lex is ot you kow his volume is like dow to two basically he's a very mootoe calm ormal perso ad people people do ed up lovig it so I do't thik my theory was was etirely correct but I do thik it helped to have like you kow a bit of a screw loose ad like you kow you're a very stable smart perso you do't have that much of a screw loose I thik you're almost playig from behid uh whe it comes to iteret cotet o I thik you're right I so i preparig for every episode that I do I go ad liste to that perso o other podcasts ad it's crazy how they get asked exact same questios everywhere they go because there's just kid of a template of like okay so tell me about your life like tell me why you wet this directio i your career ad I thik you've eve talked about this o my first millio you're like we do't do that we we igore all the questios that we kow everyoe's goa ask I guess maybe some people wat to hear but we ask you like the real stuff like how much do you make like what keeps you up at ight like whe have you failed or like eve more tha that you actually just ask the questios that people probably wat to hear yeah there's this there's this great thig that happes if you always ask questios like that you it's like a get out of jail free card it's like well that's just what he does versus if you just try to Sprig that o oe perso it's somethig like Whoa it's a little itrusive there but it's like oh that's just stick that's this that's the show stick like that's what they do um the you ca get away with beig a little more blut ad so uh you kow cultivatig like a image of beig you kow sort of a do't give a f slash blut persoality has all these advatages because people just create ew rules for you they're like ah you kow if a ormal perso did this yeah I would feel wrog but that's that's just Sea beig Sea that's just Sam beig Sam ma you're like whoa okay I just get to be that uh that's awesome that is awesome wow okay that's good let's keep goig what else you got cheatig scadals everyoe's talkig about it chess poker fishig I eve saw Irish dace i a ewsletter recetly so every you kow cheatig's everywhere but uh well if people are out of the loop frame it frame it for them about what what other cotroversy these okay so I do't kow all of them i depth but I've bee followig the chess oe pretty closely Magus Carlse World chess champio played Has Neima several weeks ago uh Neima beat him but the there was all this cotroversy after where Magus was actig sketchy ad the evetually came out with this statemet sayig hey I believe Has cheated I ca't speak to exactly why ad the there has bee a history of Has cheatig i the past as well so there's all of these people o the iteret who are takig sides ad sayig o Has has bee really good how could you cheat over the board ad the there's people who believe i Carlso ad are like o he's had a history of cheatig we just do't kow how ad the there's bee a similar poker cotroversy ad the a fishig oe where they were stuffig fish with like lead balls ad so I thik a buch of people have just you kow become fasciated with this idea that oh my gosh people are cheatig eve though they have bee for a log time but um I have a couple ideas aroud the idea of cheatig but I first wat to hear your take like what do you thik about these cheatig scadals well there's somethig very seductive about them I do't kow about you but like I do't follow chess ormally but whe it came to this I was like God dam it if I do't have to get to the bottom of this like you kow here goes four hours of like YouTube rabbit holdig to figure out ad I do't it's ot eve like it's a better etry poit for me tha just this perso is great or this was a great match it's like here's the cotroversy oh what is it right ad it goes back to this thig that uh I remember Daa White said oce Daa White's the presidet of the UFC ad he goes I go they were like you kow UFC is kid of the syrige small thig but you're sayig it's goig to be huge why do you believe that he goes I believe that because if you go to a park or a playgroud right ow ad you've got a basketball court people are playig basketball you got a football field people playig football you soccer over here baseball over there ad the somebody screams fights ad there's a fight goig o guess where everybody's head's turig to the fight ad that was his whole thesis of like why I thik the UFC is goig to be big because fightig is this Uiversal Uiversal thig that just gets you to tur your eck whether you wated to or ot ad it's actually kid of played out the UFC's become This Global sport you kow a five billio dollar plus compay ad um ad it succeeded i places where you kow like football does't really traslate ito Europe or Asia but fightig does fightig you kow like there's Chiese the Chiese viewership is big i the UFC so is Russia ad so is you kow wherever every little coutry so I thik cotroversy is kid of the same thig uh where like I was't that ito chess util I foud out that there might be this like Scadal what's the Scadal I gotta kow ad um ad the you look at the evidece ad you're like well there's two kid of like iterestig compoets oe is like how did how would somebody cheat that's kid of iterestig it's sort of like a Ocea's Eleve like how did they rob the bak type of thig uh because you kow you're sittig there at a chessboard it's ot olie so you kow this guy had bee he had bee caught cheatig olie admitted to cheatig olie ad may people cheat olie they basically have a program ruig because you kow AI ca play chess better tha a huma ca um but the you have how is he cheatig over the board ad there was this the somebody threw out this crazy uh Theory which was that the aal beads yeah he's got aal beads you kow basically up his butt that vibrate ad tell him you kow what to what move to make or whatever ad so I ad ad the way that Magus did it kid of added to it so he first whe he got beat it was big ews because Magus is the greatest player i the world maybe the greatest player of all time he the goes olie ad he tweets out this thig like um he tweet out like a meme or a quote from a soccer coach it was like you kow I ca't if I say what I wat to say I'll get i trouble ad people are like what is he tryig to say the he comes out with a statemet sayig I thik he cheated the he plays him agai ad oe move or two moves ito the match he just uh resigs he basically quits ad walks away um agai sort of like sayig I'm ot goa play with this cheater ad um ad so some people are like is this just sour grapes ad other people are like o he kows somethig but he's ot said why he thiks he's cheatig yet ad the over probably because he does't kow right well like I do't thik that he thiks that Has cheated but he does't kow how ad that's probably why he has't bee descriptive about it because he's like I thik this guy's cheated there's two pieces of evidece oe is just he says he did't look like he was tryig like the guy beat me I'm the greatest player i the world ad I kow what it looks like whe people try to beat me they're very focused ad cocetrated he barely looked like he was payig attetio yet he played basically a perfect game i BP that was his first thig was just like I did't feel like he tried ad he beat me um so that was the first piece of evidece ad the secod was people wet back ad looked at all of his like past games as he raked up because he's had like this crazy rise from like you kow a ormal great player to like Grad Master or whatever top raked player ad they ad they did this thig where they basically ca put your game history back i this like chess solver egie ad see how close to perfect how close to AI did you play ad like the greatest players of all time have played like at 62 or 72 percet of their moves matched you kow like what the AI would do like perfect moves ad he's had like several mii games where he's at 100 ad like the greatest players ever will have like o games at 100 durig their like rise to the top ad so it's sort of fishy o that frot like you kow really this guy's makig like 100 Game Theory optimal moves uh ad the greatest players ever at best are like at 70 ad so that those are the kid of pieces of evidece agaist him but still obody kows how he did it if he if he is ideed cheatig yeah exactly so I used to play chess competitively as a kid ad both of those are very compellig argumets the first oe especially like if you've ever played chess across the board if you're i a tough situatio certaily if you're playig the world chess champio you are cocetratig so hard I thik there's stats that say like you kow a full chess match ca bur like a thousad calories or whatever if you're sittig at the board for several hours ad so I thik that's really compellig my questio is a how do you prove that someoe's cheatig I do't kow if you ca I thik you ca prove someoe has the itet to cheat if you catch them with like yeah some aal beads or somethig i their shoe but how do you actually prove that someoe has cheated ad the I'm also curious to kow how these you kow like the Chess Federatio Etc how are they goig to chage the way they operate to catch the shootig i the future I do't I do't kow I guess they make people walk through a metal detector but um right yeah you ca always do that yeah exactly like ad I'm ot goig to get caught oce you kow it's just like you kow i the Olympics you have you saw or wada who basically the agecies that are supposed to catch you from dopig but what happes is guys go to the Olympics they test clea they break all the records ad oh they're a atural athlete ad the six years later wada updates their tests so they ca test for ew stuff uh that's ew to them but the athlete had it all alog ad the they go back to Tesla samples ad they're like oh turs out they were dopig right ad this has happeed like a few times i i the Olympics ad i High Level Sports Ad so there's this problem of like it's this cat ad mouse game betwee cheaters ad the i the ad the sort of like the ati-cheat but ati-cheat is actually a really iterestig busiess-like category so I did't really kow much about this util we started buildig a startup that was i the gamig space this was the compay that eded up gettig acquired by twitch but whe we were buildig i the space we would play games i the office just for fu we'd play fortite played OverWatch played a buch of buch of differet games like that ad um ad the you you sort of see two thigs oe is like wow the importace of like um this sort of had-eye coordiatio aim basically beig able to aim ad shoot uh i these games is like critical ad the there's like you'll play somebody ad you're like oh my God like as soo as I peek aroud the corer boom I get headshot immediately perfectly oe time every time by the same guy ad it's like oh it's a Aimbot it's like basically somebody's usig a basically like a piece of software that will automatically just aim for your head every sigle time more tha a huma ca do ad so the the games have all these ati-cheat mechaisms built i to prevet that because it's I mea it ruis the game whe you have uh whe you have cheaters ad so at the highest levels ad these games ow have like a really big competitive scee Esports like they have to figure out how to catch this ad so you have a software game ad the you have software ati-cheap which is differet tha like the Olympics or this like chest metal detector thig where it's a it's a offlie game ow you do offlie offlie ati-cheat ad so I thik that the offlie world eeds to sort of lear more from the gamig World about ati cheat because there's these compaies that are quite big that are ati-cheat providers to all games because each game idividually ca't build the security system that's goig to stop every you kow potetial form of cheatig ad so there's just idividual compaies that are like we are ati-cheat software every game becomes our customer ad we ca use them ad so I thik that's what's goa have to happe which is that you're goig to have to have like ati-cheat compaies that are security systems basically for the for the competitive Itegrity of the games ad I thik chess ad poker ad you kow fishig ad others are goig to have to like ramp up i this area um But the iroy is this is the best thig that's ever happeed to us best thig sice Quee's Gambit right more attetio tha ever uh o these thigs yeah I mea there's like cospiracy theories which is like Hus ad Magus are i this together ad like they're they're associated with chess.com ad they're all doig this to just like hype up chess which I do't thik is true but I mea it's kid of crazy whe you thik about fishig for example how was the fact that there was lead balls i a fish ot caught earlier I mea I thik you're right that some of these i-perso sports are just like way behid o the cocept of cheatig which is aciet uh so I'm iterested to see how that progresses but oe idea um like you said there's goa be this wave of measures that eeds to be put i place ad I just thought of this this thig that I saw you guys have had Peter levels o the podcast before ad he had so Nomad list is oe of his compaies ad for ages people kept tryig to copy Nomad list there was all these compaies were like we're goa hire 10 egieers ad we're goa just like smash you right because you're oe egieer ad ad we're just goa take all your data ad he would just for fu uh put i fake data so there was this coutry or city that he put i called dorobo ad he would just do that to be like who copied my data set just to see which I kid of loved ad I am I was tryig to thik through how that maybe could be applied elsewhere I do't kow if it could be applied to chess but you could imagie like what if stockfish just had just had like a couple icorrect moves right that would catch the cheater it's like oh you played G4 you were ot supposed to play G4 if you were a great player you would kow otherwise ad I just woder what other kid of spoofs or like tricks you could put i as ati-cheatig measures well I do't kow if you saw this uh I was lookig at I was o Twitter this morig ad I saw that Elo had tweeted um at somebody this story as that was pretty iterestig so somebody tweeted at Elo they go hey Elo back i the day you had this 2008 I thik there was somebody who was leakig iteral compay data ad um they kept leakig ito ews outlets it was bad for busiess ad the you foud them uh I'm curious how did you fid them whe it whe it had happeed ad he goes actually it's a iterestig story because ormally elo's tweets are just memes but he's like actually it's a iterestig story we set everybody i the compay the same email but with oe slightly differet space somewhere i the email um so like we would you kow betwee this period we would either do two spaces or oe space but we it was a log email so we were able to create like a uique figerprit for everybody i the compay we set them all a slightly uique uh email that was like sort of like biary proof that this was your email that got out ad it's like so we foud the perso that way you kow we caught them sort of immediately it was the fastest path to catchig them versus goig through all the email like servers ad like pattig people dow as they leave the the leave the factory like how are we goa fid this perso ad that was the best way to do it was to put out somethig juicy that was false space out the thig differetly ad the they caught the perso immediately ad he's like you kow that we we you kow we asked them to pursue a career i aother compay ad like a way of sayig it yeah that's so clever yeah so I'm iterested to see how this progresses because I do Woder it's like who who wis did the cheaters wi do the ati-cheatig measures wi historically I mea i gamig what was the case like could the ati-cheatig measures keep up with the cheaters o like the the best cheater is always oe step ahead because you kow there's always a the bigger the more moey ivolved the bigger the icetive to cheat ad so you're aytime you have a big pot of moey you're goa fid people are goig to cheat this is why you kow PayPal ad Facebook ad others they they have so much so much staff every day dedicated just to catchig cheers ad um because there's a huge amout of moey ivolved i it this is why people love Bitcoi they're like wow if somebody could have hacked this or spoofed this or doe a double sped there is a literally like half a trillio dollar prize for the takig ad because it has't that just shows you how secure this is so it's like the absece of a hack shows a security ad so with with aywhere there's a lot of moey there's goig to be a icetive to cheat ad there's always the hardest part is that it's usually ot sophisticated so for example i the if you followed the poker oe that's bee goig o it's like this that this uh like high stakes game i La that they stream the game ad so they have like a twitch Chael or whatever where they're streamig the game so it's like kid of like the World Series of Poker but just goig o all the time people are playig for like each perso has like 100 or 300 000 o the table so you get these pots ad like half a millio dollar pots ad this girl makes this This Woma's playig this had ad she plays it i a way that kid of makes o sese she has Jack four off suits ad does't make ay sese why you would eve be i the had uh the board has o Jacks o fours ad it has a flush draw has a straight draw the other guy has both ad he Betsy bats she you kow she calls it all i whe she has othig ad she wis the had ad people are like there is o way you could make that call like there's o you're holdig those cards the oly explaatio is you looked at your cards wrog ad you thought you had somethig else but she kid of like if you read the audio is there too where she's like o I do't have it right she's basically sayig I do't have uh they're like do you have a three she's like o I do't have a three um ad so she's basically she's like oh you kow I just did this as a bluff catcher ad literally the guy's face whe she calls at first he's like oh you got me I did't have it you caught my bluff but the she turs over her cards ad he's like okay you caught my bluff but you caught my bluff with that that makes zero sese that you would ever try to eve catch a bluff with that ad he's literally stoe-faced for like a miute ad a half he does't say aythig he's just lookig ad his eyes are just movig betwee the table ad her ad he's like you could tell the computer ad his brai is like breakig it's like there's o way this could have happeed he is detected basically i a aomaly ad a a aomalous move that has to be somethig like cheatig like there's o other explaatio it's ot about how somebody could make you kow a 200 000 bet o with those cards uless you kew what my cards were ad what's comig out ad so um ad so they like lauched this ivestigatio ad like I thik Reddit ad YouTube are great at that where they like crowdsourced the ivestigatio they're like fidig old clips ad they're like more tha ay police officer could do you kow put Reddit o the case like whe they foud the Bosto Bomber or whatever I do't kow if that eded up beig true or ot but like it's the same idea ad so they're showig basically what it looks like happeed was just there's a huma iput i the productio team who was probably feedig her the iformatio ad she had like a vibrator device o her like i her pocket or i her pats or somethig like that um that was like sigalig her just like if it vibrates that meas you're good uh like call the bet if it does't vibrate that meas you do't have you're ot wiig full ad um that's what people thik is the like sort of most likely explaatio for this at this poit but that's hard because it's huma egieerig ad like um there's this coferece that happes every year I forgot the ame of it but you might kow it's i Vegas ad it's like the hacker coferece I do't kow if you've heard it's like Defco or somethig like that it's like oh that's familiar yeah it's basically it's the umber oe like hackerco hacker covetio like you kow like I do't kow why aybody would go to this it's like you kow walkig ito a you kow a shark De basically but oe thig that they showed like I kid of wet dow this Rabbit Hole of like what what do they talk about at this thig ad oe thig they showed is just how much of like hacks is ot like brilliat Computer Egieerig it's somebody just callig you ad beig like hey I'm just verifyig some iformatio with the bak here could you just tell me your mother's maide ame ad your date of birth ad your last four of your Social all right thak you you're cofirmed othig else to worry about ad the they just take that ad they call the bak ad they say hey I eed to chage my password ca you chage it for me I forgot what my old oe is but you kow oh my security questios yeah my mother's maide ame is this ad here's my last four ad the they get the password chage to take all your moey ad they did't hack i the system they just literally like they catfished you right they sort of like uh the you kow huma egieerig they basically just like trick you ito givig up iformatio ad that's how a lot of the big hacks happe is they just trick a huma ito givig them their password ad the they do't eed to break i it's like you gave me the keys I ca just walk right i exactly that's why Sim swappig is like oe of the ufortuately super commo ways of hackig people because people will just go ito like a ATT ad be like hey I'm this perso this is my phoe umber I lost my sim could you give me a ew oe ad they just get that um ad so yeah it's it defiitely humas are the like faulty piece there's a great busiess that came out of this Isight which was there's may of them ow but but whe I heard this I remember thikig oh my God that is a geius it's basically a busiess that goes to compaies ad they say hey the umber you kow that 90 of these hacks happe just because your your employee is goig to just type their password o the wrog page ad they're like yeah I guess that's true yeah they go so here's what we're goa do we're goa sed false phishig emails to your employees ad um but do't worry like you kow whe they type it i we're just goa give you a report every moth because you're payig for a cotract which is just to say this employee click this lik ad this would have bee a breach oh thakfully we caught it you ca ow educate the employees better ad we you kow this is a way to like you kow make sure that your your employees are ot goig to fall for this ad um ad those compaies do extremely well because it's way cheaper to like prevet the hack that way just by havig somebody kid of stress test your employees i that way try to break through the system ad just say hey here is where we foud a vulerability ad um I thought that was just like a geius busiess category to be i yeah I I have a co-worker that fell for oe of those recetly ad she was like oh ma I got to do this traiig but I was like really that's all we have to do we just got to do a little bit of traiig like this seems pretty faulty if all these employees are clickig o this but I kid of love the idea of ethical hackig have you see there's bee someoe recetly I thik their their code ame or their hacker ame is like bjorkska or somethig ad they've hacked ito three of Idoesia's like large govermet databases ad at first people were like oh ma this is just Idoesia is a huge coutry right i terms of populatio they're like oh they've got like Millios hudreds of millios of Records the first time ad the the secod time they were like oh my gosh this happeed agai like this perso has way too much data but by the third time they were like this perso is just exposig how fragile all of our systems are because they have't you kow set the data aywhere they're just like you guys you have to fix this ad they're just like usig proof to show it istead of sayig you kow goig to people ad tweetig like our systems are really isecure or whatever istead they're just like let me just show you ad I thik it's uh I mea I thik have you heard of whiz I thik that's like eter some sort of Eterprise security software uh it was the fastest or at least oe of the fastest that hit 100 millio ARR recetly like faster tha deal faster tha a lot of the compaies that we're familiar with yeah just Wiz right I thik that's the the ame of it with Cloud security yeah exactly yeah they had they came out with some I've ever heard of this compay it's like hey we're the fastest growig compay i the world exactly ad they do is this what they do they do the sort of like bug Bouty stuff yeah 100 millio errors 18 moths I do't kow exactly what they do but I just kow there's some sort of Eterprise security software ad uh yeah they're like quietly the the biggest fastest we're ot the biggest the fastest growig compay i a while yeah that's isae all right eough uh eough hackig ad cheatig ad stealig uh although I do I just I love that stuff I ca't get eough I love the cotroversy I kow same let's do these iteret portfolios so I thik these are these are pretty cool I I thik these are good ispo for people ad you've curated a group of them let me just kid of set it up which is basically people have these kid of like um persoal websites portfolios ad I thik you you wrote somethig o this doc I wat you to explai you wrote evidece greater tha greater tha greater tha cofidece uh so what is that what does that mea ad the why do these iterest you yeah so I thik i the age of social media especially it's like really easy for you to be see as a expert i somethig you kow someoe who's doe o marketig ca look up a buch of Wikipedia articles ad start tweetig threads o it ad a buch of people who do't kow ay better ca just say oh wow this perso has a lot of cofidece right ad you kow that's fie um but what I thik is importat especially i this era where everyoe ca seem like a expert is evidece of evidece over cofidece ad what do I mea by evidece it's like do't tell me you're this busiess Expert show me the busiesses that you've built ad how successful they are ad how you built them or let me see how you built them istead of you tellig me how you built them ad I thik oe versio of this for idividuals are these persoal portfolio sites so you kow you ca have a site which agai it's like I've writte for fortue ad I have this may followers o Twitter or you kow all of these thigs that you've made up that tell people you're cofidet istead of how about you just show me your skills ad some of these portfolios which will hopefully pull up here um are just really fasciatig because as soo as I go to them I'm like this perso is a badass I wat to hire them just based o what I see here based o the evidece that they are a killer Creator ad so we should pull some of them up but for example pull up this oe from Bruo Simo ad tell me what you see so basically it's Bruo hyphe simo.com ad you lad ad it's literally a like Jeep that's o the scree you hit the click Start there's a Jeep that's o the scree ad it says use your keys to move aroud ad it's like ad you just like you ca you ca go forward ad you ca just like drive ito stuff it's like a 3D it's basically a game uh ad it's like his resume almost but you ca basically drive aroud crash ito stuff ad like clearly this perso is like super taleted artist creative web developer type of perso it's like all right I'm goa drive to the projects sectio um ad like okay I'm i the project sectio ad I ca see their differet thigs if I park my car o the ope o the parkig spot there it'll ope that like you kow um that lik to go see that website that they built ad this is amazig like this is oe of the best portfolios I've ever see like this is like stuig yeah it's pretty awesome pull up um aother oe which is just aother example click the oe that says iteractive resume from Robbie Leoardi so Robbie okay oh my God it's like basically like a game of Mario so there's a character ad I'm scrollig ad all of a sudde I'm like okay level oe that's his about oh wow this is cool um this is sick it's basically like a chart of like oh I'm good at desig illustratio whatever but it's like I'm ruig through the level ad I'm like learig these differet thigs about the perso about what they're ito okay NBA fa oh my God ow I'm uderwater I'm doig the uderwater level yeah so this is crazy they basically just took a resume desiged it beautifully ad made it play like a Mario Mario game ad at the ed of the level it's like cotact me here if you wat to work with me or whatever you kow here's my cotact form you you've wo you've made it to the ed of the level you've wo the thig I love about this is I assume these people are ot applyig for jobs but ca you imagie if you had a job opeig ad you had like a hudred typical resumes of people beig like yeah I've worked here for three years or I've doe this I have this degree ad the oe of them was this how could you ot hire this perso how could you so I made somethig like this whe I applied for so whe I moved to Silico Valley I did this so basically I I applied to two jobs whe I wated to move to Silico Valley I applied to stripe ad I applied to a place called mokey Ifero stripe everybody kows tured ito like you kow whatever 100 billio dollar compay I would have bee like employee I do't kow like 35 40 at the time so it would have bee great it would have probably made like 10 30 millio dollars somethig like that just as like a mid-level sales Biz Dev type guy that I was goig to joi as ufortuately I crashed ad bured i the iterview whe he was like sell me this pe ad I was like uh ad I just fumbled um but the uh the other job I applied to is mokey Ifero ad mokey Ifero was a really cool compay ad oe thig that's iterestig is the more the compay shows that they're uique the more you sort of get the vibe ad you're like okay I ca read the room you're cool ad uique ad you appreciate like a you kow creativity ad a sese of humor so that's how I'm goa apply so I did't sed i a resume I just made a website ad I you kow I ca't code I'm ot like you're way more techically taleted let aloe these people who are like you kow freakig you kow they're creatig like you kow fake Mario game as their resume but I made a basic website that was basically ad I just set a email I tried to copyright it while I was like you kow my first lie of the email was like um you kow uh hey Michael um I'm applyig for the I saw your role for product maager um ad eve though you kow I have oe of the qualificatios you're lookig for let me explai to you why I'm the ma for the job ad like you kow I thik that was like goa get his attetio to read the ext thig just to be like is this guy you kow a complete clow or like is there somethig here ad so I wrote this email ad I said you kow I rather tha add a you kow resume to the stack of resumes like I made a website for you ad so I my my website was't about me it was like why I should work at Mokey Ifero so it was like more tailored um to him ad I had these same thigs I had this like uh skills chart but I icluded stuff that I was't good at I was like hard work I was like ah 40 percet like you kow that was like oe of my lowest skills I was like I'm kid of lazy actually um you kow I I'm kid of lazy I ca't force myself to do thigs that I do't love to do but I gave them like thigs ad the i the iterview like I remember oe of the guys was like why would you apply for a job ad write your hard work is ot high ad I was like well I'm glad you asked I ca explai here's here's what I thik about that ad um ad so I had this whole thig ad I kid of wrote a resume exactly for them I was like you kow here's some of the my mottos here's like I looked at your compaies here's some of the thigs I thik I could do for them ad so I kid of tailored it to that ad I remember he later told me he was like you kow if you had't doe that website like there's o way we would have hired you because o paper you had like literally oe of the qualificatios we were lookig for like the etire job descriptio was like just ot you but um that website was really cool it was really uique obody else had doe somethig like that ad so it just made me feel like we got to talk to this guy ad so that was like the the i that got me got me the job i the i the i the ed yeah I mea I thik I've hired a decet amout ow ad there's so may people who mass apply to jobs ad they're like yeah I'm iterested i this job ad I have the qualificatios but the times I've bee really impressed is like you ca tell someoe really wats to work there ad has doe their research ad you kow the secod they get i you almost do't have to trai them o the compay you probably have to trai them o other thigs but you kow they uderstad exactly what you're tryig to do because they've bee followig your compay or your team or your people for a while um so I thik that's that's spot o right let's do a couple of a couple of these other oes so uh yeah let's rapid fire through so the eil.fu oe I thik I've talked about before o here this oe's awesome um so it's -e-a-l dot fu but I do't thik pull it up but basically it's like it's just like the headlie is a tiy website o the iteret ad the he's basically got a buch of little like iteractive little projects that he's made that you could do ad I I remember I wet through the Absurd trolley problems oe um which is basically like if you remember i school where it's like you kow there's a trai o the tracks it's goa you kow kill five people but you ca pull the switch ad just kill this oe would you do it ad you're like yeah I guess I'd rather kill oe tha five I thik I would do it ad the it basically like chages it to like but the oe is a baby would you do it ad you're like o I would't kill the baby ad the it's like it's like okay but the other oe is five cats would you do five cats ad it's like it just takes you through 30 like absurd variatios of that of that questio ad each oe whe you say yes or o it says 74 of people agree with you 26 disagree there's bee 2.1 millio votes of this ad you're like wow that's like that's cool you ca see where do you differ from like you kow the masses whe it comes to these thigs ad so that's the oe I did are there ay other cool oes that he's got here well I mea he has so may I'll call it a couple so it feels like he just took all of his Curiosities which are the same Curiosities that may people have ad tur them ito these yeah iteret games of sorts so oe of them is like explore the scale of space or um see who was alive ad ext year you're like I woder who was alive i 1870 ad you ca kid of see what um famous people or ifluetial people were alive at the same time um aother oe that's fu is the iteret's greatest debates so it's all these questios like you kow is it gif or GIF or I ca't remember what some of the other oes are but he gets the iteret to vote o them um so you actually you kow you get the aswer to the iteret's greatest questios but as you ca see if people are watchig o scree there's just so may that he's built like this oe that was like desig the ext iPhoe it just lets you drag ad drop like you ca put a camera i the like I put it like off to the side like halfway off the camera you could put a Adroid logo o it um that's good this is this guy's kid what does this guy do for a livig is he this is what he does or he's like I do't kow let's pull him I'm pullig up his Twitter his ame is Neil Agarwal I thik so he says creative coder yeah this guy's cool um yeah I like this persoal portfolio you had a pretty good portfolio website that you had built uh do you like maitai it or what did you do with it I have't updated it i a while but I will say the page that gets the most traffic or or really gets the most people who cotact me is my ope page so a lot of well ot a lot some startups have a ope page uh that is we make this much reveue we have this may page views ad ormally they do't go much past that I created a equivalet I have't updated it i a while but it was basically like okay this is how much I make from my persoal projects but it's also my goals ad it's like if my goal for example is I exercise 50 of the days i a year I hooked it up to my spreadsheet ad it publicly tracks it daily so you ca see exactly how much I'm doig or it shows what books I'm readig or I do't kow silly thigs like that but people seem to love that for some reaso yeah yeah people do love that they wish they were like as orgaized ad o top ad clear about their goals as you that's why they love it but you oly put your side project reveue o here right yeah I've actually you kow what I have debated I've bee watig to write a article which is about my like could say moetary Ascet through life um as i wow that's that's a that's like post-ecoomic my moetary o o that's amazig I will say so the reaso it's a Ascet is ot because I make so much ow but I just made so little startig out ad so I've bee watig to write about that because it's kid of you kow I feel like I've leared some thigs but also I thik it'd be iterestig to actually publicly say i this year I made X ad ad I've see some celebrities do this but you kow 20 years later they're like look at my tax returs right but I kid of wat to do it ow ad say look five years ago I was makig X ad the I made X ad ad to really like publicly share how much I made how like what jobs they were Etc ad what I leared alog the way but I kow I'm just goa get trashed you kow what I mea because because sayig you make a buch of moey ow is ot it's ot somethig people love so I've stayed away from it but I kid of wat to ayway yeah yeah I've thought about those same thigs ad I'm just like uh why do I wat to ivite this i I do't eed this what's my a buch of moey you're like I do't eed to kid of  myself out there for the uh for the attetio aymore so there's kid of this like this like couterproductive thig where it's like well the reaso I would for me I'm very like simple which is like uh people whe they do that stuff they're like I just wat to icrease trasparecy i the world or like you kow I just wat other people like me to kow you kow I thik you kow we should opely share I thik we should opely share strategies I thik we should opely share tactics I thik you should privately with a group of trusted people share the your umbers itself but to publicly for everybody share how much you make I thik oly is is i your iterest whe you're ot makig that much but it's growig the oce you're makig a buch at that poit the kid of risk reward flips I thik at least um ad so you kow I'm ot that ito that but but this cool I oticed there's o 2022 goals what happeed we're almost at the ed I kow I gotta I gotta post it but I will say I'm way behid o them so maybe that's why are you are you like a goal hitter like do you hit like most of these goals o I mea I'm oe of those people who I hit some of them but that's how I thik it should be right if you're hittig 100 you're ot settig ambitious goals if you're hittig othig the you're just lost i the world probably but I hit maybe 50 every year yeah I thik at Amazo they had said somebody had said like 75 if you if you're hittig more tha 75 of your goals like you were't sufficietly um ambitious if you're hittig less tha 75 of your goals uh or like maybe maybe it was a little bit less tha that I do't kow but it was like you're ot executig well eough like you did't you did't do a good eough job um yeah okay uh all right what else we got you got a buch of ideas o here you wat to give us let's go some busiess ideas some quick oes okay so busiess ideas I do't kow if there's oe like a ew busiess idea here but I thought this was iterestig I'm callig it salty bowls ad smelly water ad so basically there's two examples of everyoe wats to eat healthier uh that's I thik a pretty Uiversal huma uh wat at least ad two compaies are doig somethig iterestig here so Kiri which is k-i-r-i- it's a compay i Japa ad they partered with the uiversity ad they foud a way to make to basically use a super weak electrical curret both i bowls ad Chopsticks so that whe you're eatig somethig about the ioizatio or the electric curret makes somethig taste saltier so you ca imagie like whe you actually eat somethig your taste buds or yeah what there's some somethig happeig chemically o your togue ad they've basically foud a way to somewhat reproduce this so you ca actually eat food every ot everyoe a lot of people icludig myself love salty food you're actually eatig foods with less soda but they taste salty ad the I'm just goig to quickly tack o the other oe which is similar where it's I'm callig it smelly water because it's this compay called air up which basically has foud a way to create a sceted rig aroud a bottle's lip so similarly they foud a way to make somethig taste better i this case through scet istead of electrical curret ad they I thik raised 68 millio dollars ad so I thik it's just this like iterestig pheomea of how do you make somethig ad there's the trai how do you make somethig taste good without actually chagig the caloric or the the itake of the food ad hag o your ote here says it's makig 100 millio plus a year as like a estimate accordig to Glimpse air up is this like flavored rig of the bottle so you basically you brig a bottle up to your lips the water itself is ot flavored the rig is sceted or flavored i some way so that whe you drik the water you get that you kow whatever hit of citrus or whatever you're lookig for is that it yes ad I put accordig to Glimpse because I was't able to reproduce or like fid that umber olie I do't kow where they got it um they defiitely raised a buch of moey I just do't kow if that Reveue umber is correct that is crazy wow um have you tried either of these o I wat to I saw the Chopstick Bowl Oe very recetly so I kid of wat to order oe ad the I have't tried air up wow uh these are this is fasciatig I had ot uh I did't kow you had said the salty Bowl smelly water thig I did't uderstad what it was util you said that but that's crazy I mea the the sort of like salt taste without without extra salt that's kid of I mea that's that's kid of Geius

are ot a b testig their meus ad so I thik someoe eeds to go ad create a b testig software that restaurats ca igest super easily [Music] what's up Steph Steph is back uh back i the house oe of the most requested retur guests of all time um we should have you o more what are you doig ow by the way you uh you left the hustle slash HubSpot you wet to Adreesse is that where you're at still are you doig other thigs yeah exactly I'm at a16z I'm their ew podcast host so they've had a podcast for like seve or eight years ad the it wet o Hiatus they looked for a ew host ad that's me we have't goe live yet but we will be soo every time you come o you brig this like documet that's basically like it's sort of what me ad Sam do but whe me ad Sam do a episode we have like two or three bullet poits each like three words ad I have two ad he has two ad that's how we prepare you sed this like Ecyclopedia Britaica of topics ideas like half fake thigs i your head um so like I'm lookig at this this is like seve or eight pages or somethig like that oh o 12 pages log so um we have a lot to choose from so where do you wat to start I wated to share this oe idea I thik I've actually talked about it o aother couple pods but with the pademic a buch of restaurats have goe olie quote uquote they have the QR codes right ad you pull up the meu some restaurats have reverted back to the physical meu but tos of restaurats are still usig these QR codes ad somethig that I thik of every sigle time as a iteret marketer is why they are ot a b testig their meus ad so I thik someoe eeds to go ad create a b testig software that restaurats ca igest super easily ad the basis of this is well a if you thik about what has made so may iteret compaies successful it is the fact that they have these alterate worlds that they ca a B test right Google home page are we usig this fot or this fot I'm usig this color this color Netflix you kow Amazo every all of these large iteret compaies have used this but also there's the restaurat equivalet so the hustle did a story o this woma Michelle baesh ad you ca just look up desig restaurat meus the hustle or somethig like that to get the article but we wrote about this woma who her job was literally to go redesig meus physical meus ad based o her uderstadig of huma psychology orietatio there's like this Zed or Z effect o the meu ad the way people scroll she was able to figure out how to get oe restaurat just as a example to brig i ie dollars more per customer by redesigig their meu same products but just the orietatio the order of the meu the desig of it ad I was thikig why are't restaurats ot usig this as i ow we have the QR code which allows us to direct someoe to ay uique lik right we have the digitizatio of this ad so you could hire someoe like Michelle ad she could probably figure out how to do this for you or someoe should be just create a software that allows restaurats to do this they do't eed to chage their meu at all but they ca mess aroud with the meu desig the same way you mess aroud with ladig page desig ad get higher coversio ad of course the average restaurat ower is ot goig to kow how to do this ad that's why I thik there eeds to be just some sort of software that says hey we ca icrease your coversios right by 50 we ca icrease your average customer value by three dollars whatever it is ad I I have't see it aywhere this is amazig um this is great I remember so I started a restaurat back i the day my very first startup was a restaurat ad we were but whe we fially got to lauch log story short we were like um do we wat to lauch a physical restaurat we got to sig this 10-year lease with a persoal guaratee that souds scary ad our Metor kid of was like could you test your cocept by doig delivery oly ad basically it was like a cloud what a cloud kitche is today but this was back you kow more tha 10 years ago ow where there was o doordash there was o ubereats at the time but it was like What If people could just order olie what if you just had a kitche earby dowtow there was o physical seatig there's o there's o storefrot you just deliver ad we were like uh okay liste so we tried it ad whe you do that you're really coscious of well our whole meu is olie so that meas we could ru a test to just see like what makes people order more or ot ad so we did the most basic of a B test the first thig we did was we were tryig to lower prices ad we talked to this guy Da ariely who was um he wrote this book predictably irratioal ad we were like Da uh hey we're you kow three dudes tryig to build this like sushi restaurat startup you kow um do you kow aythig about the restaurat idustry ad he's like I kow a lot about the restaurat idustry he goes I get paid by compaies to come i ad help them with either the meu or like he told us about some experimet I thik Pada Express had paid him a buch of moey to do to basically say could we get people we have healthy items o the meu ad people tell us the reaso they do't eat here is because it's uhealthy but obody orders the healthy items so like what gives ad he's like oh humas are predictably irratioal they'll tell you oe thig ad the they wo't do it ad he the oe test he had made was whe you walk ito a Pada Express istead of puttig both items o the meu ad just havig you choose it was right whe you walked through the door it would say there was like a little agel path it's like if you're goa eat healthy go this way ad there was like the dev you're goig to eat idulgetly you kow like if you wat full flavor go this way ad whe people make that choice upo walkig i ad the they oly see a meu of those items like they were happier with their choice ad they ordered more of those items ad so he like figured out that was the oly way he could desig this restaurat to do that oe thig um ad so similarly he was like oh he goes oh yeah I ca help your busiess your prices are too low ad we go what do you mea like everybody says Sushi's too expesive we're tryig to make it more affordable like how is that a bad thig well you kow like what are you talkig about ma we're tryig to do the people's work here he's like he's like sushi uh people like do you ever wat to if I told you you ca eat cheap sushi would you wat that ad he's like o ad he's like you kow he's like so just like the you kow wie idustry uh people buy expesive thigs because it makes them feel good that they bought a higher quality thig so he goes just test the price so we did it we basically upped the price 50 o oe meu versus the other we just a b tested it ad we had like higher coversio rate o the higher price which is crazy um like ot eve just it etted more moey it was higher coversio rate o the higher price so that was like the first time I saw this like meu a b testig I mea thik about how big of a lift that is like if you ca covert every customer at a higher rate at a higher dollar amout that's like you kow meaigful i a idustry that's like 10 margis ad so we did that the we tested other thigs like uh istead of just sayig you kow this is a whatever this is like the Philadelphia roll we use salmo it's like Alaska salmo had caught Alaska ciamo farm caught had had you kow hadled Alaska salmo or whatever we just started addig all these extra words that were like othig chage othig they were all true but it's like always fresh ever Froze Alaska salmo had caught by a farmer ear you ad it's like oh people like love that ad the they would buy more ad so you could see these little meu tricks ow what I did't thik of which is your your geius idea is how do you actually tur that ito a busiess where you could become a agecy that does this for compaies you could become a piece of software that does this as AV testig of QR codes um you could do this with physical meus also by the way like you could just give out two differet versios of the physical meu ad say ad just track the tickets ad be like cool we kow what the what the checkout is for both um for how much they sped o both sides ad we ca just prove to you that meu desig a is better tha b ad like you kow your curret meu was desiged by like your iece who kows Photoshop so like you kow I thik we ca do better tha that ad if we do that if we beat your curret meu the you pay us you kow 50 a moth ad we'll keep ruig tests for you yeah I thik this is actually a really really great idea yeah I thik the key differece I mea you always look for iflectio poits I thik you guys say or chages ad so before you're right you could do this with physical meus but you kow the data is so much harder to get ad you have to like match up the physical meu with the POs software you're usig but ow I do't kow what the percetage is but we all kow a to of restaurats are usig these QR codes ad so they're already they've like take the major step that they wet before of digitizig the experiece ad so ow what you eed to do is just apply those aalytics ad so some compay eeds to just go create the software ideally it itegrates ito the POS so you just literally ca pop out a report at the ed but eve if you do't have it itegratig with the POs I thik you ca eve just like look at oh how log does someoe sped o this meu versus this meu how are they scrollig yeah what items are beig sold I do't thik you would eve eed to because you're basically so basically they'll sca the QR code ad it's like you kow Google optimize or optimizig oe of those they'll eter a ABS exactly ad the you're goa pass the the fial value Here's the fial cart that they're checkig out with to the you kow to to the thig ad whe it's i perso uh like i restaurat like they check out uh with everythig you kow they do't they do't like they do't walk away you kow they actually do order food so you ca kid of like bet pretty heavily o that I woder if people would also do this with uh doordash or ubereats like yeah could I be a service that just optimizes your doordash listig with photos meus copy ad like if you're a atioal chai that's i like you kow whatever thousad cities ad I ca get you a extra half a poit coversio or extra two dollar you kow cart size that's pretty meaigful for for these uh you kow these restaurats that are o o these delivery platforms yeah I was thikig about that too because ubereats meus are always so log ad you kow there's like that what's it called where you have too may optios um paralysis by aalysis or whatever exactly exactly yeah ad also ubereats will have three or so items at the top of like our most popular items ad I do't kow if Uber actually selects that for the restaurat but if you had the optio ad actually if you're a egieer at Uber workig o this like create a platform where people ca a B test right o ubereats so that they feel like that's a platform where they're makig more moey versus doordash versus their ow like that's a value add passed if someoe created their ow olie meu that people ordered from uh which would make obviously more sticky for people to stay there well I looked at the startup that was I kow this works because I looked at the startup I was doig exactly this what they were doig was they would go to a local mom-ad-pop restaurat that was like let's say Chiese food they'd say great you kow Mr Has Chiese you kow great you're you're everybody loves you locally ad ow you're o doordash but like your photos are kid of crap your you kow your descriptios are all off you're ot sayig what foods are vega eve though they are vega you're just you do't list them um like you're just ot optimized so what he would do is he would parter with the restaurat ad he would just create a shadow like a like a cloe of the brad but he would call it like you kow um like choo choo Chiese like it would be like a more like catchy ame the all the photos are super bright um so it's like you kow o a backdrop of like orage or red or whatever ad like really good lookig photos ad they would trim the meu dow he'd be like look people come i here they wat like fried chicke ad they wat dumpligs ad they wat this ad that ad so he would just do like this is just these items um he wrote better copy he took better photos ad the all it was was whe a order gets placed o those restaurats that same restaurat just gets a ticket they do't eve it's like they do't eve kow it's like from this other brad basically ad the later they would sed them packagig that's like hey if it comes i through this Regis this like uh ticket priter um put it i the choo choo Chiese like box do't put it i Mr Has like you kow like local box um ad so they just create a separate packagig so he's like yeah we have 200 restaurats we do like you kow 17 millio i gmv ad we operate oe of these restaurats they were already restaurats that already existed all we did was just Rebrad them for Postmates ad ubereats ad doordash ad I was like oh my God like this is like a mid-blowig idea that yeah actually works he's like yeah they love it because they get like 30 extra Reveue just because we're better at marketig o those platforms tha they are ad um I woder how they do it ow I actually have't caught up with them I did't I did't ed up ivestig because I was like I do't kow where this goes like this I feel like this could just get like baed or blocked i oe secod but like uh it was a fasciatig idea ad that guy was really taleted who was doig it yeah uh oe more thig o the idea of food have you see that I thik it's the FDA their food pyramid or at least i Caada that's what we called it the food pyramid ad you have like all these grais ad they're like eat this much bread ad ad they're rethikig that have you see that they're they're really well they should right carbs the foudatio like fruit was this time fruit ad vegetables were this like they shared a little sectio like they had buk beds at the top of the pyramid it was crazy yeah they were uh you kow people got upset because I mea a simple example is they'd be like uts o uts too much fat ad the they'd be like butt white bread okay you kow they're foudatioal ad so uh they're comig out with a ew food pyramid of sorts ad that impacts I did't kow this but foods ca uh apply the word healthy to their products like you kow Brads you could like actually have the word healthy o your cereal box as a example based o this food pyramid or some sort of requisites ad they're chagig that ad I just thought I do't kow if there's a busiess idea here but I feel like there's goig to be a to of cotet a to of chages comig out because of this because I mea the food pyramid was pretty foudatioal ad so I do't kow what the busiess idea here is but it's just like oe of those uh there's there's got to be somethig here well that's a good iflectio I'll give you aother iflectio like that that I was thikig about over the weeked um so you kow like the law chage that allows College athletes to moetize their brad or face called il ame ad like this ad um so that came ito effect this year ad so ow ow College athletes ca get paid for example whe we did our MFM camp we paid uh puff Johso this basketball player at North Carolia to come like drop i ad play pickup with us it was just a cool momet it's like oh yeah here's like this guy who's goa be i the NBA i a couple years like he's just he's just playig with us ad we paid him I do't eve kow what like 200 or somethig like that to show up for for a hour ad he's like cool like I got othig else goig o o a Saturday like I'll go pick up 200 bucks ad by the way he was a awesome guy um so that's a little like Market that's gotte created I was like I was askig Be I was like how did you book him like what'd you use ad he's like I just dm'd him o Istagram ad I was like oh iterestig there's o there's ot really a great Marketplace yet that's coectig College athletes to the like people who wat to pay them for their you kow just to to do a appearace or a sposorship whatever there's some people tryig but obody's like do't kow there's goig to be oe compay that just ows this here's the liquidity it's like we got all the athletes ad the like because of that we got all the brads ad we take care of all the trasactios ad you do't eed to use Istagram DMS ad like vemo like it just all happes to your platform ad we have all the reportig that we had over to the uiversities so I thik that's like a big idea is like create Agel list for like you kow the il Marketplace the secod thig is just what opportuities does this ope up so Dave Portoy who rus Barstool they jumped o this pretty early they're like oh great we'll have a Barstool athlete program where you ca sig up to be a Barstool athlete which will help you get these deals ad uh they came out they're like we're takig zero percet cut o these deals I do't kow how or why but they just decided to say that ad um ad he's like we have 200 000 College athletes as part of this ow some some like huge umber like that that's isae so I was thikig I was like ma so may differet products ad brads have bee built off ifluecer marketig everythig from you kow movemet watches which were like early to Istagram like ifluecer marketig ad built 100 millio dollar watch brad um you kow Sugar Bear Hair you kow they got the Kardashias to be take pictures with this gummy you kow bitig this little blue gummy ad that became like this icoic look ad the that became like agai 100 millio dollar like you kow uh supplemets brad ad so ow I'm thikig well all of a sudde overight you ow ca tap ito the ifluecer marketig of college athletes across the coutry ad probably very few brads are doig this just yet ad you could almost create a compay just workig backwards from all right if I could get every ifluetial College athlete to post somethig what product should I make that's goig to work best with their audiece ad like their trust ad all that stuff because it's kid of a usaturated marketig chael right ow i a usaturated marketig chael right ow is like worth it ca be worth like 100 millio dollars if you ca if you ca be the first to figure it out that debt platform ad so you could kid of thik about what products would Their audiece buy because ow I ca reach them for a very low cost ad they this could't this literally could't happe before so you have this iflectio chage ad so I thik that's aother like braistorm that somebody could do ad figure out what product would fit that category ad just work backwards from the distributio what would you do do you have ay thoughts o if you were to choose that as your Chael people talk about like Chael Market but what what product would you create well so so thikig o the Eco like kid of the e-commerce side just for a secod so I was like all right you ca uh ad I do't kow if eCommerce is the best like I thik probably like some credit card or debit card or somethig like that is probably the best like if you could basically go get you kow um a millio people A millio college studets to start usig your credit card because you got you kow 100 000 athletes to just say like oh I'm usig this ad sig up for this bous Poit program ad you get a you kow whatever 500 credit for sprig break or whatever I do't kow you could come up with some offer but you distribute it through these athletes ad you basically say cool if I if I get at age 18 to 21 somebody to pick my credit card what's that Worth to me um ad I thik that's probably like you kow oe of the best categories you could be i but if it's ot that let's just take e-commerce for a secod like I thik that you wat the you fid that you would first go to the class of the best e-commerce products to like high purchase rate high like kid of lock-i basically high margi um you kow low shippig why like ative deodorat was such a great product it weighed less tha a poud so you could ship it i a ormal evelope so shippig was low cost it's repurchased because you wear deodorat every day ad you ru out of it every whatever two three moths ad so you're goa keep buyig i um it's high margi like it oly costs this much to make ad they could charge whatever 20 bucks to to sell a two pack ad so like it had a lot of the traits that make for a great product ad so I would try to figure out like whether it's like protei powder or like athletic grees or you kow like some you kow like sparklig water brad or like you kow some Seltzer smelly water oh yeah smelly water I try to figure out some product like that that's like Mass Appeal high margi High repeat purchase rate ad the I would just like work backwards from that ad I would't do you kow products that are like you kow big oe-off purchases with the low repurchase I just try to stay away from those so I would go look at the wiers of like curret e-commerce ad the I would try to you kow retrofit those ad be like would that like particularly hit with a um a college groud like I thik like a eergy drik would be like amazig uh like I thik I thik if you could do like you kow whatever Red Bull rock star type of thig is if you could just make like the ext the ext either you kow um vitami water or or eergy drik I thik that's probably the the strogest oe but if it's ot that the some kid of like subscriptio product like maybe deodorat or um I do't kow somethig like that this is probably where I'd go for it deodorat would work you ca be like do't smell o the court or some you kow cheesy thig like that but yeah I thik deodorat would actually be well you could also like just if it's like just riffig o that you could take the deodorat Brads ad you could like make it specific you could make the sese specific to the to the campus so like you kow whatever whatever the ame like you kow you have like Loghor you kow whatever for UT ad the you have like the ames of the scets that like kid of fit that market it's the same scet you're just labelig it differetly depedig o where it's at but you're ow pullig ito that kid of like brad Affiity they already have with their with their campus or whatever else ad it makes sese for the athlete to be promotig that because it's like agai they're like a college athlete for that school maybe you could do some thigs like that to like juice how um you kow how attractive it is I kid of love that because I I'm just you kow my marketig hat is o ad there's so may taglies you could be like siff out your competitors or like you kow you you could imagie these iteret Wars of like oh ma that like that Uiversity is set sucks or that like high school like have you smelt that like that that stuff's asty or like you kow people actually competig o which which college has you kow for every every stick that's bought here we you kow drop oe stik bomb at your rival school like that's like some some way to like you kow compete with the other schools ice I ca't fid this cliet ifo have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every applicatio every team ca stay aliged o out of syc spreadsheets or duelig databases HubSpot grow better okay let's do a quick oe which is I actually saw this i the treds ewsletter a while ago I did't write this but um it was the stat which is the average perso speds oe ad a half thousad dollars after a breakup I have o idea where the stack came from but defiitely got the wheel spiig ad they came up with a buch of differet ideas which I thik actually are gettig some tractio divorce party ideas is somethig that gets search volume breakup cake um people throwig their ow breakup parties ad I was just like huh I do't kow if there's you kow specific brads that are takig this o but I was like huh that that's that oe ad a half thousad dollars do't kow where it came from but there's somethig there that's like if I'm if I'm F Jerry you kow that like Istagram accout ad they have these like they built a kid of like a little media Empire they have a buch of other accouts but they also have products they make like they made that that card game I thik they they make some products yeah if I was if I was oe of those accouts I would be jumpig o this I would basically say all right it's already viral it's meme worthy it's it's remarkable people are goa talk about this so how do I make you kow like the best breakup cake delivery service or yes um you kow like uh the Revege body kit ad it's like you kow we sed you this like the seve day detox um where you said you're like a healig Crystal we sed you like a juice clease ad whatever else to like you kow get that perso out of your out of your life so you're goa get the bad juju you kow away ad I'd be like you kow this is called bad juju or whatever ad I would just try to create like a viral product through that um because I thik it's o brad ad I thik it has like eough demad where there's you could see this doig you kow two to te millio dollars a year all orgaic yeah just because the product is so viral um you kow it's probably ot goig to be eormous but there's a there's eough of a iche there especially if you're oe of these accouts because you already got distributio or you're somebody who goes to those accouts ad parters with them ad says hey I got the right product for you guys let's do you kow some kid of profit share ad I'll ru this busiess ad you guys just help me promote this like you kow uh whatever like the breakup vodka ad it's like you kow this is the break of vodka kit or whatever you kow whatever the thig is yeah I mea I'm imagiig you kow all the tropes of someoe gets broke up with ad they become super fit ad like they get a PhD ad they just become like the best versio of themselves after the breakup does't always happe but you could imagie somethig like that eve less work it's like what's those what are those like voodoo dolls where you like poke it ad you're like you kow you're just sedig like ill will towards them you could just like upload a photo of your perso we prit you a doll that looks like you kow like close eough like them ad like you ca do that that remids me of did you see that startup empty it was fake did you did you hear about this it's I thik it was you kow it had the silly spellig to it was like e-m-p-t-i or somethig ad it was a fake startup that people thought was real ad basically they set people these empty boxes um ad the whole idea was like look we sed you these empty boxes ad there's some like motivatioal quote from Buddha i it ad it's like you kow rid yourself of all the thigs you do't eed i your life ad the idea is that people are supposed to take all their juk put it i these boxes ad sed it to this compay for free but they pay this compay to sed them these boxes um but it was a fake startup ad all these people are writig about it they're like oh this is so smart like what a cool compay yeah exactly it was a joke but yeah actually you could do that with this too you could sed them the breakup box it's like put all their crap i this all their crap they've left i your house that remids you of them put it i this sed it to us ad we will sed you a video of us like burig this box i this like epic way ad like you get to have that at the ed that's it those are the types of ideas you could do with this ice so you were right before we started reportig you were startig to tell me you go here's my theory of why people like this podcast ad what is your theory okay so there are may reasos to love my first millio I thik there's somethig that you guys have doe especially recetly whe you ad Sam just go back ad forth ad you tell a really fuy joke ad the Sam just starts laughig hysterically like i a cotagious way that most people would hold back maybe o a podcast but it's it's literally as people say like you're i the room with him ad it remided me of this subreddit I foud recetly called r slash cotagious laughter 4.5 millio people subscribe to this ad it's oe of I thik the top hudreds subreddits out there ad it's literally just a feed of people laughig ad there's there's dozes of posts every day ad I I was just as I wet dow it I was like there's gotta be a post of Sam ad Sea well okay let me tell you a couple iterestig thigs about this first I thik this must I thik the subreddit must be kid of like almost like ew or growig faster recetly right because I had't heard of this subreddit before ad I kid of keep a eye o o the top oes but maybe I just missed it but I I've also see this tred o Tick Tock I do't kow if you've see it somebody will be like I'm a cliical psychologist ad I ca make you happier i the ext 10 secods repeat after me huh ad there's like a duet so that guy's like hot excuse like haha ad you're just like okay I see where this is goig ad the she just gets like haha ad like by the ed both people are just crackig up like because it's like 10 Deep ad uh you ca't help yourself like the body will just start like geuiely laughig just from makig the soud like it goes both ways it's ot like somethig fuy happes therefore I break out laughig it's like if you break out laughig itetioally you could just like it could it's like somethig fuy just happeed basically ad um yeah ad so I've thought about this like cotagious laughter thig i two ways oe is as if I was thikig about the podcast ad I was like I was watchig I was watchig the all lad pod ad um I love that podcast but they do somethig that really bothers me which is oe of them will crack a joke ad the other guys do't what I call Selva joke like they do't laugh um ad I do't kow if they do't laugh because they're tryig to they're a they do't thik it's fuy B it's ot that they're tryig to keep it serious or see they might just edit it where they just do't use the audio track from someoe because it kid of makes it a little choppy because you're usig oe o top of the other but it totally chages the vibe of somethig whe um i a podcast especially whe the other perso actually sells your joke like if you if you try to crack somethig ad I go with it or ad this works for for other thigs o my first millio too I call it the homie move where Sam would be like do you kow how may people buy this thig ad I kow it's probably a high umber if he's tellig me like that but I'll be like I do't kow what like like 100 ad just to give them they're like o dude a millio ad like I give them that like assist basically ad so there are several thigs like that where you got to kid of sell the other perso's thig ad it's ot fake it's just like be expressive like laugh hard react big that stuff works whe it comes to cotet ad people are very shelled up about that sort of thig um I do't kow if that that is i lie with what you're talkig about totally oe of the fuiest momets o my first millio was your Orlado Bloom story which I thik if I just heard you tellig it by yourself I'd be like yeah that's pretty fuy but Sam's laughter layered oto that where he was you could just tell he was dyig as you were tellig that story just made it hoestly top five momets o my first millio history for me but that's why I thik this subreddit is so great eve i their rules or their like Commuity guidelies you kow how someoe posts somethig ad there's typically a bot that says hey report this if X Y ad Z o that subreddit it's like report this if you're laughig at a joke or some sort of icidet ad ot the laughter specifically they're like we oly wat you to be o here to hear other people laughig so I do't kow I just thought that was like a fu a fu thig ad remided me of why I thik some people love my first millio it's just so authetic well you're you're about to do a podcast ad do you remember what I told you my advice to you whe it came to to doig a podcast I do't kow if you remember this this is a couple years ago ow I actually do't you should tell me I was like um do't be too ormal or I was like you're too ormal I was like you eed to be um yeah like to me the ideal podcast guest is like half isae um ad what that meas is like there's thigs that they're ot eve aware of that are iside like Sam has a to of these where he's like dude I was thikig you kow you kow you thik about like what happes if someoe broke right behid me right ow ad tried to kill me I'm like o I do't thik that the fact that you thik I thik that meas you're kid of isae like you're ot eve aware of that that's a weird thig you're doig you thik that other people do that too ad the the secod is like beig willig to say somethig crazy stuff like that uh ad the the third is like they do't hedge um ad like try to dowplay like most people are basically takig their ow little volume kob ad turig it dow all the time just because they wat to fit i ad so the best thig you could do if you wat to be a persoality o the Iteret is like you ca't have that I'm tryig to fit i tur the volume dow thig you gotta like tur it up if aythig um ad so that was my theory o it ow I do thik I might be wrog because like there's people like Lex Friedma or whoever who are successful with their podcast ad like you kow it's like you kow Lex is ot you kow his volume is like dow to two basically he's a very mootoe calm ormal perso ad people people do ed up lovig it so I do't thik my theory was was etirely correct but I do thik it helped to have like you kow a bit of a screw loose ad like you kow you're a very stable smart perso you do't have that much of a screw loose I thik you're almost playig from behid uh whe it comes to iteret cotet o I thik you're right I so i preparig for every episode that I do I go ad liste to that perso o other podcasts ad it's crazy how they get asked exact same questios everywhere they go because there's just kid of a template of like okay so tell me about your life like tell me why you wet this directio i your career ad I thik you've eve talked about this o my first millio you're like we do't do that we we igore all the questios that we kow everyoe's goa ask I guess maybe some people wat to hear but we ask you like the real stuff like how much do you make like what keeps you up at ight like whe have you failed or like eve more tha that you actually just ask the questios that people probably wat to hear yeah there's this there's this great thig that happes if you always ask questios like that you it's like a get out of jail free card it's like well that's just what he does versus if you just try to Sprig that o oe perso it's somethig like Whoa it's a little itrusive there but it's like oh that's just stick that's this that's the show stick like that's what they do um the you ca get away with beig a little more blut ad so uh you kow cultivatig like a image of beig you kow sort of a do't give a f slash blut persoality has all these advatages because people just create ew rules for you they're like ah you kow if a ormal perso did this yeah I would feel wrog but that's that's just Sea beig Sea that's just Sam beig Sam ma you're like whoa okay I just get to be that uh that's awesome that is awesome wow okay that's good let's keep goig what else you got cheatig scadals everyoe's talkig about it chess poker fishig I eve saw Irish dace i a ewsletter recetly so every you kow cheatig's everywhere but uh well if people are out of the loop frame it frame it for them about what what other cotroversy these okay so I do't kow all of them i depth but I've bee followig the chess oe pretty closely Magus Carlse World chess champio played Has Neima several weeks ago uh Neima beat him but the there was all this cotroversy after where Magus was actig sketchy ad the evetually came out with this statemet sayig hey I believe Has cheated I ca't speak to exactly why ad the there has bee a history of Has cheatig i the past as well so there's all of these people o the iteret who are takig sides ad sayig o Has has bee really good how could you cheat over the board ad the there's people who believe i Carlso ad are like o he's had a history of cheatig we just do't kow how ad the there's bee a similar poker cotroversy ad the a fishig oe where they were stuffig fish with like lead balls ad so I thik a buch of people have just you kow become fasciated with this idea that oh my gosh people are cheatig eve though they have bee for a log time but um I have a couple ideas aroud the idea of cheatig but I first wat to hear your take like what do you thik about these cheatig scadals well there's somethig very seductive about them I do't kow about you but like I do't follow chess ormally but whe it came to this I was like God dam it if I do't have to get to the bottom of this like you kow here goes four hours of like YouTube rabbit holdig to figure out ad I do't it's ot eve like it's a better etry poit for me tha just this perso is great or this was a great match it's like here's the cotroversy oh what is it right ad it goes back to this thig that uh I remember Daa White said oce Daa White's the presidet of the UFC ad he goes I go they were like you kow UFC is kid of the syrige small thig but you're sayig it's goig to be huge why do you believe that he goes I believe that because if you go to a park or a playgroud right ow ad you've got a basketball court people are playig basketball you got a football field people playig football you soccer over here baseball over there ad the somebody screams fights ad there's a fight goig o guess where everybody's head's turig to the fight ad that was his whole thesis of like why I thik the UFC is goig to be big because fightig is this Uiversal Uiversal thig that just gets you to tur your eck whether you wated to or ot ad it's actually kid of played out the UFC's become This Global sport you kow a five billio dollar plus compay ad um ad it succeeded i places where you kow like football does't really traslate ito Europe or Asia but fightig does fightig you kow like there's Chiese the Chiese viewership is big i the UFC so is Russia ad so is you kow wherever every little coutry so I thik cotroversy is kid of the same thig uh where like I was't that ito chess util I foud out that there might be this like Scadal what's the Scadal I gotta kow ad um ad the you look at the evidece ad you're like well there's two kid of like iterestig compoets oe is like how did how would somebody cheat that's kid of iterestig it's sort of like a Ocea's Eleve like how did they rob the bak type of thig uh because you kow you're sittig there at a chessboard it's ot olie so you kow this guy had bee he had bee caught cheatig olie admitted to cheatig olie ad may people cheat olie they basically have a program ruig because you kow AI ca play chess better tha a huma ca um but the you have how is he cheatig over the board ad there was this the somebody threw out this crazy uh Theory which was that the aal beads yeah he's got aal beads you kow basically up his butt that vibrate ad tell him you kow what to what move to make or whatever ad so I ad ad the way that Magus did it kid of added to it so he first whe he got beat it was big ews because Magus is the greatest player i the world maybe the greatest player of all time he the goes olie ad he tweets out this thig like um he tweet out like a meme or a quote from a soccer coach it was like you kow I ca't if I say what I wat to say I'll get i trouble ad people are like what is he tryig to say the he comes out with a statemet sayig I thik he cheated the he plays him agai ad oe move or two moves ito the match he just uh resigs he basically quits ad walks away um agai sort of like sayig I'm ot goa play with this cheater ad um ad so some people are like is this just sour grapes ad other people are like o he kows somethig but he's ot said why he thiks he's cheatig yet ad the over probably because he does't kow right well like I do't thik that he thiks that Has cheated but he does't kow how ad that's probably why he has't bee descriptive about it because he's like I thik this guy's cheated there's two pieces of evidece oe is just he says he did't look like he was tryig like the guy beat me I'm the greatest player i the world ad I kow what it looks like whe people try to beat me they're very focused ad cocetrated he barely looked like he was payig attetio yet he played basically a perfect game i BP that was his first thig was just like I did't feel like he tried ad he beat me um so that was the first piece of evidece ad the secod was people wet back ad looked at all of his like past games as he raked up because he's had like this crazy rise from like you kow a ormal great player to like Grad Master or whatever top raked player ad they ad they did this thig where they basically ca put your game history back i this like chess solver egie ad see how close to perfect how close to AI did you play ad like the greatest players of all time have played like at 62 or 72 percet of their moves matched you kow like what the AI would do like perfect moves ad he's had like several mii games where he's at 100 ad like the greatest players ever will have like o games at 100 durig their like rise to the top ad so it's sort of fishy o that frot like you kow really this guy's makig like 100 Game Theory optimal moves uh ad the greatest players ever at best are like at 70 ad so that those are the kid of pieces of evidece agaist him but still obody kows how he did it if he if he is ideed cheatig yeah exactly so I used to play chess competitively as a kid ad both of those are very compellig argumets the first oe especially like if you've ever played chess across the board if you're i a tough situatio certaily if you're playig the world chess champio you are cocetratig so hard I thik there's stats that say like you kow a full chess match ca bur like a thousad calories or whatever if you're sittig at the board for several hours ad so I thik that's really compellig my questio is a how do you prove that someoe's cheatig I do't kow if you ca I thik you ca prove someoe has the itet to cheat if you catch them with like yeah some aal beads or somethig i their shoe but how do you actually prove that someoe has cheated ad the I'm also curious to kow how these you kow like the Chess Federatio Etc how are they goig to chage the way they operate to catch the shootig i the future I do't I do't kow I guess they make people walk through a metal detector but um right yeah you ca always do that yeah exactly like ad I'm ot goig to get caught oce you kow it's just like you kow i the Olympics you have you saw or wada who basically the agecies that are supposed to catch you from dopig but what happes is guys go to the Olympics they test clea they break all the records ad oh they're a atural athlete ad the six years later wada updates their tests so they ca test for ew stuff uh that's ew to them but the athlete had it all alog ad the they go back to Tesla samples ad they're like oh turs out they were dopig right ad this has happeed like a few times i i the Olympics ad i High Level Sports Ad so there's this problem of like it's this cat ad mouse game betwee cheaters ad the i the ad the sort of like the ati-cheat but ati-cheat is actually a really iterestig busiess-like category so I did't really kow much about this util we started buildig a startup that was i the gamig space this was the compay that eded up gettig acquired by twitch but whe we were buildig i the space we would play games i the office just for fu we'd play fortite played OverWatch played a buch of buch of differet games like that ad um ad the you you sort of see two thigs oe is like wow the importace of like um this sort of had-eye coordiatio aim basically beig able to aim ad shoot uh i these games is like critical ad the there's like you'll play somebody ad you're like oh my God like as soo as I peek aroud the corer boom I get headshot immediately perfectly oe time every time by the same guy ad it's like oh it's a Aimbot it's like basically somebody's usig a basically like a piece of software that will automatically just aim for your head every sigle time more tha a huma ca do ad so the the games have all these ati-cheat mechaisms built i to prevet that because it's I mea it ruis the game whe you have uh whe you have cheaters ad so at the highest levels ad these games ow have like a really big competitive scee Esports like they have to figure out how to catch this ad so you have a software game ad the you have software ati-cheap which is differet tha like the Olympics or this like chest metal detector thig where it's a it's a offlie game ow you do offlie offlie ati-cheat ad so I thik that the offlie world eeds to sort of lear more from the gamig World about ati cheat because there's these compaies that are quite big that are ati-cheat providers to all games because each game idividually ca't build the security system that's goig to stop every you kow potetial form of cheatig ad so there's just idividual compaies that are like we are ati-cheat software every game becomes our customer ad we ca use them ad so I thik that's what's goa have to happe which is that you're goig to have to have like ati-cheat compaies that are security systems basically for the for the competitive Itegrity of the games ad I thik chess ad poker ad you kow fishig ad others are goig to have to like ramp up i this area um But the iroy is this is the best thig that's ever happeed to us best thig sice Quee's Gambit right more attetio tha ever uh o these thigs yeah I mea there's like cospiracy theories which is like Hus ad Magus are i this together ad like they're they're associated with chess.com ad they're all doig this to just like hype up chess which I do't thik is true but I mea it's kid of crazy whe you thik about fishig for example how was the fact that there was lead balls i a fish ot caught earlier I mea I thik you're right that some of these i-perso sports are just like way behid o the cocept of cheatig which is aciet uh so I'm iterested to see how that progresses but oe idea um like you said there's goa be this wave of measures that eeds to be put i place ad I just thought of this this thig that I saw you guys have had Peter levels o the podcast before ad he had so Nomad list is oe of his compaies ad for ages people kept tryig to copy Nomad list there was all these compaies were like we're goa hire 10 egieers ad we're goa just like smash you right because you're oe egieer ad ad we're just goa take all your data ad he would just for fu uh put i fake data so there was this coutry or city that he put i called dorobo ad he would just do that to be like who copied my data set just to see which I kid of loved ad I am I was tryig to thik through how that maybe could be applied elsewhere I do't kow if it could be applied to chess but you could imagie like what if stockfish just had just had like a couple icorrect moves right that would catch the cheater it's like oh you played G4 you were ot supposed to play G4 if you were a great player you would kow otherwise ad I just woder what other kid of spoofs or like tricks you could put i as ati-cheatig measures well I do't kow if you saw this uh I was lookig at I was o Twitter this morig ad I saw that Elo had tweeted um at somebody this story as that was pretty iterestig so somebody tweeted at Elo they go hey Elo back i the day you had this 2008 I thik there was somebody who was leakig iteral compay data ad um they kept leakig ito ews outlets it was bad for busiess ad the you foud them uh I'm curious how did you fid them whe it whe it had happeed ad he goes actually it's a iterestig story because ormally elo's tweets are just memes but he's like actually it's a iterestig story we set everybody i the compay the same email but with oe slightly differet space somewhere i the email um so like we would you kow betwee this period we would either do two spaces or oe space but we it was a log email so we were able to create like a uique figerprit for everybody i the compay we set them all a slightly uique uh email that was like sort of like biary proof that this was your email that got out ad it's like so we foud the perso that way you kow we caught them sort of immediately it was the fastest path to catchig them versus goig through all the email like servers ad like pattig people dow as they leave the the leave the factory like how are we goa fid this perso ad that was the best way to do it was to put out somethig juicy that was false space out the thig differetly ad the they caught the perso immediately ad he's like you kow that we we you kow we asked them to pursue a career i aother compay ad like a way of sayig it yeah that's so clever yeah so I'm iterested to see how this progresses because I do Woder it's like who who wis did the cheaters wi do the ati-cheatig measures wi historically I mea i gamig what was the case like could the ati-cheatig measures keep up with the cheaters o like the the best cheater is always oe step ahead because you kow there's always a the bigger the more moey ivolved the bigger the icetive to cheat ad so you're aytime you have a big pot of moey you're goa fid people are goig to cheat this is why you kow PayPal ad Facebook ad others they they have so much so much staff every day dedicated just to catchig cheers ad um because there's a huge amout of moey ivolved i it this is why people love Bitcoi they're like wow if somebody could have hacked this or spoofed this or doe a double sped there is a literally like half a trillio dollar prize for the takig ad because it has't that just shows you how secure this is so it's like the absece of a hack shows a security ad so with with aywhere there's a lot of moey there's goig to be a icetive to cheat ad there's always the hardest part is that it's usually ot sophisticated so for example i the if you followed the poker oe that's bee goig o it's like this that this uh like high stakes game i La that they stream the game ad so they have like a twitch Chael or whatever where they're streamig the game so it's like kid of like the World Series of Poker but just goig o all the time people are playig for like each perso has like 100 or 300 000 o the table so you get these pots ad like half a millio dollar pots ad this girl makes this This Woma's playig this had ad she plays it i a way that kid of makes o sese she has Jack four off suits ad does't make ay sese why you would eve be i the had uh the board has o Jacks o fours ad it has a flush draw has a straight draw the other guy has both ad he Betsy bats she you kow she calls it all i whe she has othig ad she wis the had ad people are like there is o way you could make that call like there's o you're holdig those cards the oly explaatio is you looked at your cards wrog ad you thought you had somethig else but she kid of like if you read the audio is there too where she's like o I do't have it right she's basically sayig I do't have uh they're like do you have a three she's like o I do't have a three um ad so she's basically she's like oh you kow I just did this as a bluff catcher ad literally the guy's face whe she calls at first he's like oh you got me I did't have it you caught my bluff but the she turs over her cards ad he's like okay you caught my bluff but you caught my bluff with that that makes zero sese that you would ever try to eve catch a bluff with that ad he's literally stoe-faced for like a miute ad a half he does't say aythig he's just lookig ad his eyes are just movig betwee the table ad her ad he's like you could tell the computer ad his brai is like breakig it's like there's o way this could have happeed he is detected basically i a aomaly ad a a aomalous move that has to be somethig like cheatig like there's o other explaatio it's ot about how somebody could make you kow a 200 000 bet o with those cards uless you kew what my cards were ad what's comig out ad so um ad so they like lauched this ivestigatio ad like I thik Reddit ad YouTube are great at that where they like crowdsourced the ivestigatio they're like fidig old clips ad they're like more tha ay police officer could do you kow put Reddit o the case like whe they foud the Bosto Bomber or whatever I do't kow if that eded up beig true or ot but like it's the same idea ad so they're showig basically what it looks like happeed was just there's a huma iput i the productio team who was probably feedig her the iformatio ad she had like a vibrator device o her like i her pocket or i her pats or somethig like that um that was like sigalig her just like if it vibrates that meas you're good uh like call the bet if it does't vibrate that meas you do't have you're ot wiig full ad um that's what people thik is the like sort of most likely explaatio for this at this poit but that's hard because it's huma egieerig ad like um there's this coferece that happes every year I forgot the ame of it but you might kow it's i Vegas ad it's like the hacker coferece I do't kow if you've heard it's like Defco or somethig like that it's like oh that's familiar yeah it's basically it's the umber oe like hackerco hacker covetio like you kow like I do't kow why aybody would go to this it's like you kow walkig ito a you kow a shark De basically but oe thig that they showed like I kid of wet dow this Rabbit Hole of like what what do they talk about at this thig ad oe thig they showed is just how much of like hacks is ot like brilliat Computer Egieerig it's somebody just callig you ad beig like hey I'm just verifyig some iformatio with the bak here could you just tell me your mother's maide ame ad your date of birth ad your last four of your Social all right thak you you're cofirmed othig else to worry about ad the they just take that ad they call the bak ad they say hey I eed to chage my password ca you chage it for me I forgot what my old oe is but you kow oh my security questios yeah my mother's maide ame is this ad here's my last four ad the they get the password chage to take all your moey ad they did't hack i the system they just literally like they catfished you right they sort of like uh the you kow huma egieerig they basically just like trick you ito givig up iformatio ad that's how a lot of the big hacks happe is they just trick a huma ito givig them their password ad the they do't eed to break i it's like you gave me the keys I ca just walk right i exactly that's why Sim swappig is like oe of the ufortuately super commo ways of hackig people because people will just go ito like a ATT ad be like hey I'm this perso this is my phoe umber I lost my sim could you give me a ew oe ad they just get that um ad so yeah it's it defiitely humas are the like faulty piece there's a great busiess that came out of this Isight which was there's may of them ow but but whe I heard this I remember thikig oh my God that is a geius it's basically a busiess that goes to compaies ad they say hey the umber you kow that 90 of these hacks happe just because your your employee is goig to just type their password o the wrog page ad they're like yeah I guess that's true yeah they go so here's what we're goa do we're goa sed false phishig emails to your employees ad um but do't worry like you kow whe they type it i we're just goa give you a report every moth because you're payig for a cotract which is just to say this employee click this lik ad this would have bee a breach oh thakfully we caught it you ca ow educate the employees better ad we you kow this is a way to like you kow make sure that your your employees are ot goig to fall for this ad um ad those compaies do extremely well because it's way cheaper to like prevet the hack that way just by havig somebody kid of stress test your employees i that way try to break through the system ad just say hey here is where we foud a vulerability ad um I thought that was just like a geius busiess category to be i yeah I I have a co-worker that fell for oe of those recetly ad she was like oh ma I got to do this traiig but I was like really that's all we have to do we just got to do a little bit of traiig like this seems pretty faulty if all these employees are clickig o this but I kid of love the idea of ethical hackig have you see there's bee someoe recetly I thik their their code ame or their hacker ame is like bjorkska or somethig ad they've hacked ito three of Idoesia's like large govermet databases ad at first people were like oh ma this is just Idoesia is a huge coutry right i terms of populatio they're like oh they've got like Millios hudreds of millios of Records the first time ad the the secod time they were like oh my gosh this happeed agai like this perso has way too much data but by the third time they were like this perso is just exposig how fragile all of our systems are because they have't you kow set the data aywhere they're just like you guys you have to fix this ad they're just like usig proof to show it istead of sayig you kow goig to people ad tweetig like our systems are really isecure or whatever istead they're just like let me just show you ad I thik it's uh I mea I thik have you heard of whiz I thik that's like eter some sort of Eterprise security software uh it was the fastest or at least oe of the fastest that hit 100 millio ARR recetly like faster tha deal faster tha a lot of the compaies that we're familiar with yeah just Wiz right I thik that's the the ame of it with Cloud security yeah exactly yeah they had they came out with some I've ever heard of this compay it's like hey we're the fastest growig compay i the world exactly ad they do is this what they do they do the sort of like bug Bouty stuff yeah 100 millio errors 18 moths I do't kow exactly what they do but I just kow there's some sort of Eterprise security software ad uh yeah they're like quietly the the biggest fastest we're ot the biggest the fastest growig compay i a while yeah that's isae all right eough uh eough hackig ad cheatig ad stealig uh although I do I just I love that stuff I ca't get eough I love the cotroversy I kow same let's do these iteret portfolios so I thik these are these are pretty cool I I thik these are good ispo for people ad you've curated a group of them let me just kid of set it up which is basically people have these kid of like um persoal websites portfolios ad I thik you you wrote somethig o this doc I wat you to explai you wrote evidece greater tha greater tha greater tha cofidece uh so what is that what does that mea ad the why do these iterest you yeah so I thik i the age of social media especially it's like really easy for you to be see as a expert i somethig you kow someoe who's doe o marketig ca look up a buch of Wikipedia articles ad start tweetig threads o it ad a buch of people who do't kow ay better ca just say oh wow this perso has a lot of cofidece right ad you kow that's fie um but what I thik is importat especially i this era where everyoe ca seem like a expert is evidece of evidece over cofidece ad what do I mea by evidece it's like do't tell me you're this busiess Expert show me the busiesses that you've built ad how successful they are ad how you built them or let me see how you built them istead of you tellig me how you built them ad I thik oe versio of this for idividuals are these persoal portfolio sites so you kow you ca have a site which agai it's like I've writte for fortue ad I have this may followers o Twitter or you kow all of these thigs that you've made up that tell people you're cofidet istead of how about you just show me your skills ad some of these portfolios which will hopefully pull up here um are just really fasciatig because as soo as I go to them I'm like this perso is a badass I wat to hire them just based o what I see here based o the evidece that they are a killer Creator ad so we should pull some of them up but for example pull up this oe from Bruo Simo ad tell me what you see so basically it's Bruo hyphe simo.com ad you lad ad it's literally a like Jeep that's o the scree you hit the click Start there's a Jeep that's o the scree ad it says use your keys to move aroud ad it's like ad you just like you ca you ca go forward ad you ca just like drive ito stuff it's like a 3D it's basically a game uh ad it's like his resume almost but you ca basically drive aroud crash ito stuff ad like clearly this perso is like super taleted artist creative web developer type of perso it's like all right I'm goa drive to the projects sectio um ad like okay I'm i the project sectio ad I ca see their differet thigs if I park my car o the ope o the parkig spot there it'll ope that like you kow um that lik to go see that website that they built ad this is amazig like this is oe of the best portfolios I've ever see like this is like stuig yeah it's pretty awesome pull up um aother oe which is just aother example click the oe that says iteractive resume from Robbie Leoardi so Robbie okay oh my God it's like basically like a game of Mario so there's a character ad I'm scrollig ad all of a sudde I'm like okay level oe that's his about oh wow this is cool um this is sick it's basically like a chart of like oh I'm good at desig illustratio whatever but it's like I'm ruig through the level ad I'm like learig these differet thigs about the perso about what they're ito okay NBA fa oh my God ow I'm uderwater I'm doig the uderwater level yeah so this is crazy they basically just took a resume desiged it beautifully ad made it play like a Mario Mario game ad at the ed of the level it's like cotact me here if you wat to work with me or whatever you kow here's my cotact form you you've wo you've made it to the ed of the level you've wo the thig I love about this is I assume these people are ot applyig for jobs but ca you imagie if you had a job opeig ad you had like a hudred typical resumes of people beig like yeah I've worked here for three years or I've doe this I have this degree ad the oe of them was this how could you ot hire this perso how could you so I made somethig like this whe I applied for so whe I moved to Silico Valley I did this so basically I I applied to two jobs whe I wated to move to Silico Valley I applied to stripe ad I applied to a place called mokey Ifero stripe everybody kows tured ito like you kow whatever 100 billio dollar compay I would have bee like employee I do't kow like 35 40 at the time so it would have bee great it would have probably made like 10 30 millio dollars somethig like that just as like a mid-level sales Biz Dev type guy that I was goig to joi as ufortuately I crashed ad bured i the iterview whe he was like sell me this pe ad I was like uh ad I just fumbled um but the uh the other job I applied to is mokey Ifero ad mokey Ifero was a really cool compay ad oe thig that's iterestig is the more the compay shows that they're uique the more you sort of get the vibe ad you're like okay I ca read the room you're cool ad uique ad you appreciate like a you kow creativity ad a sese of humor so that's how I'm goa apply so I did't sed i a resume I just made a website ad I you kow I ca't code I'm ot like you're way more techically taleted let aloe these people who are like you kow freakig you kow they're creatig like you kow fake Mario game as their resume but I made a basic website that was basically ad I just set a email I tried to copyright it while I was like you kow my first lie of the email was like um you kow uh hey Michael um I'm applyig for the I saw your role for product maager um ad eve though you kow I have oe of the qualificatios you're lookig for let me explai to you why I'm the ma for the job ad like you kow I thik that was like goa get his attetio to read the ext thig just to be like is this guy you kow a complete clow or like is there somethig here ad so I wrote this email ad I said you kow I rather tha add a you kow resume to the stack of resumes like I made a website for you ad so I my my website was't about me it was like why I should work at Mokey Ifero so it was like more tailored um to him ad I had these same thigs I had this like uh skills chart but I icluded stuff that I was't good at I was like hard work I was like ah 40 percet like you kow that was like oe of my lowest skills I was like I'm kid of lazy actually um you kow I I'm kid of lazy I ca't force myself to do thigs that I do't love to do but I gave them like thigs ad the i the iterview like I remember oe of the guys was like why would you apply for a job ad write your hard work is ot high ad I was like well I'm glad you asked I ca explai here's here's what I thik about that ad um ad so I had this whole thig ad I kid of wrote a resume exactly for them I was like you kow here's some of the my mottos here's like I looked at your compaies here's some of the thigs I thik I could do for them ad so I kid of tailored it to that ad I remember he later told me he was like you kow if you had't doe that website like there's o way we would have hired you because o paper you had like literally oe of the qualificatios we were lookig for like the etire job descriptio was like just ot you but um that website was really cool it was really uique obody else had doe somethig like that ad so it just made me feel like we got to talk to this guy ad so that was like the the i that got me got me the job i the i the i the ed yeah I mea I thik I've hired a decet amout ow ad there's so may people who mass apply to jobs ad they're like yeah I'm iterested i this job ad I have the qualificatios but the times I've bee really impressed is like you ca tell someoe really wats to work there ad has doe their research ad you kow the secod they get i you almost do't have to trai them o the compay you probably have to trai them o other thigs but you kow they uderstad exactly what you're tryig to do because they've bee followig your compay or your team or your people for a while um so I thik that's that's spot o right let's do a couple of a couple of these other oes so uh yeah let's rapid fire through so the eil.fu oe I thik I've talked about before o here this oe's awesome um so it's -e-a-l dot fu but I do't thik pull it up but basically it's like it's just like the headlie is a tiy website o the iteret ad the he's basically got a buch of little like iteractive little projects that he's made that you could do ad I I remember I wet through the Absurd trolley problems oe um which is basically like if you remember i school where it's like you kow there's a trai o the tracks it's goa you kow kill five people but you ca pull the switch ad just kill this oe would you do it ad you're like yeah I guess I'd rather kill oe tha five I thik I would do it ad the it basically like chages it to like but the oe is a baby would you do it ad you're like o I would't kill the baby ad the it's like it's like okay but the other oe is five cats would you do five cats ad it's like it just takes you through 30 like absurd variatios of that of that questio ad each oe whe you say yes or o it says 74 of people agree with you 26 disagree there's bee 2.1 millio votes of this ad you're like wow that's like that's cool you ca see where do you differ from like you kow the masses whe it comes to these thigs ad so that's the oe I did are there ay other cool oes that he's got here well I mea he has so may I'll call it a couple so it feels like he just took all of his Curiosities which are the same Curiosities that may people have ad tur them ito these yeah iteret games of sorts so oe of them is like explore the scale of space or um see who was alive ad ext year you're like I woder who was alive i 1870 ad you ca kid of see what um famous people or ifluetial people were alive at the same time um aother oe that's fu is the iteret's greatest debates so it's all these questios like you kow is it gif or GIF or I ca't remember what some of the other oes are but he gets the iteret to vote o them um so you actually you kow you get the aswer to the iteret's greatest questios but as you ca see if people are watchig o scree there's just so may that he's built like this oe that was like desig the ext iPhoe it just lets you drag ad drop like you ca put a camera i the like I put it like off to the side like halfway off the camera you could put a Adroid logo o it um that's good this is this guy's kid what does this guy do for a livig is he this is what he does or he's like I do't kow let's pull him I'm pullig up his Twitter his ame is Neil Agarwal I thik so he says creative coder yeah this guy's cool um yeah I like this persoal portfolio you had a pretty good portfolio website that you had built uh do you like maitai it or what did you do with it I have't updated it i a while but I will say the page that gets the most traffic or or really gets the most people who cotact me is my ope page so a lot of well ot a lot some startups have a ope page uh that is we make this much reveue we have this may page views ad ormally they do't go much past that I created a equivalet I have't updated it i a while but it was basically like okay this is how much I make from my persoal projects but it's also my goals ad it's like if my goal for example is I exercise 50 of the days i a year I hooked it up to my spreadsheet ad it publicly tracks it daily so you ca see exactly how much I'm doig or it shows what books I'm readig or I do't kow silly thigs like that but people seem to love that for some reaso yeah yeah people do love that they wish they were like as orgaized ad o top ad clear about their goals as you that's why they love it but you oly put your side project reveue o here right yeah I've actually you kow what I have debated I've bee watig to write a article which is about my like could say moetary Ascet through life um as i wow that's that's a that's like post-ecoomic my moetary o o that's amazig I will say so the reaso it's a Ascet is ot because I make so much ow but I just made so little startig out ad so I've bee watig to write about that because it's kid of you kow I feel like I've leared some thigs but also I thik it'd be iterestig to actually publicly say i this year I made X ad ad I've see some celebrities do this but you kow 20 years later they're like look at my tax returs right but I kid of wat to do it ow ad say look five years ago I was makig X ad the I made X ad ad to really like publicly share how much I made how like what jobs they were Etc ad what I leared alog the way but I kow I'm just goa get trashed you kow what I mea because because sayig you make a buch of moey ow is ot it's ot somethig people love so I've stayed away from it but I kid of wat to ayway yeah yeah I've thought about those same thigs ad I'm just like uh why do I wat to ivite this i I do't eed this what's my a buch of moey you're like I do't eed to kid of  myself out there for the uh for the attetio aymore so there's kid of this like this like couterproductive thig where it's like well the reaso I would for me I'm very like simple which is like uh people whe they do that stuff they're like I just wat to icrease trasparecy i the world or like you kow I just wat other people like me to kow you kow I thik you kow we should opely share I thik we should opely share strategies I thik we should opely share tactics I thik you should privately with a group of trusted people share the your umbers itself but to publicly for everybody share how much you make I thik oly is is i your iterest whe you're ot makig that much but it's growig the oce you're makig a buch at that poit the kid of risk reward flips I thik at least um ad so you kow I'm ot that ito that but but this cool I oticed there's o 2022 goals what happeed we're almost at the ed I kow I gotta I gotta post it but I will say I'm way behid o them so maybe that's why are you are you like a goal hitter like do you hit like most of these goals o I mea I'm oe of those people who I hit some of them but that's how I thik it should be right if you're hittig 100 you're ot settig ambitious goals if you're hittig othig the you're just lost i the world probably but I hit maybe 50 every year yeah I thik at Amazo they had said somebody had said like 75 if you if you're hittig more tha 75 of your goals like you were't sufficietly um ambitious if you're hittig less tha 75 of your goals uh or like maybe maybe it was a little bit less tha that I do't kow but it was like you're ot executig well eough like you did't you did't do a good eough job um yeah okay uh all right what else we got you got a buch of ideas o here you wat to give us let's go some busiess ideas some quick oes okay so busiess ideas I do't kow if there's oe like a ew busiess idea here but I thought this was iterestig I'm callig it salty bowls ad smelly water ad so basically there's two examples of everyoe wats to eat healthier uh that's I thik a pretty Uiversal huma uh wat at least ad two compaies are doig somethig iterestig here so Kiri which is k-i-r-i- it's a compay i Japa ad they partered with the uiversity ad they foud a way to make to basically use a super weak electrical curret both i bowls ad Chopsticks so that whe you're eatig somethig about the ioizatio or the electric curret makes somethig taste saltier so you ca imagie like whe you actually eat somethig your taste buds or yeah what there's some somethig happeig chemically o your togue ad they've basically foud a way to somewhat reproduce this so you ca actually eat food every ot everyoe a lot of people icludig myself love salty food you're actually eatig foods with less soda but they taste salty ad the I'm just goig to quickly tack o the other oe which is similar where it's I'm callig it smelly water because it's this compay called air up which basically has foud a way to create a sceted rig aroud a bottle's lip so similarly they foud a way to make somethig taste better i this case through scet istead of electrical curret ad they I thik raised 68 millio dollars ad so I thik it's just this like iterestig pheomea of how do you make somethig ad there's the trai how do you make somethig taste good without actually chagig the caloric or the the itake of the food ad hag o your ote here says it's makig 100 millio plus a year as like a estimate accordig to Glimpse air up is this like flavored rig of the bottle so you basically you brig a bottle up to your lips the water itself is ot flavored the rig is sceted or flavored i some way so that whe you drik the water you get that you kow whatever hit of citrus or whatever you're lookig for is that it yes ad I put accordig to Glimpse because I was't able to reproduce or like fid that umber olie I do't kow where they got it um they defiitely raised a buch of moey I just do't kow if that Reveue umber is correct that is crazy wow um have you tried either of these o I wat to I saw the Chopstick Bowl Oe very recetly so I kid of wat to order oe ad the I have't tried air up wow uh these are this is fasciatig I had ot uh I did't kow you had said the salty Bowl smelly water thig I did't uderstad what it was util you said that but that's crazy I mea the the sort of like salt taste without without extra salt that's kid of I mea that's that's kid of Geius if you could do that all right you wat to close thigs off yeah we ca wrap it up where should people kid of fid you follow you where do they get your ext podcast that's comig out uh tell the people what they wat yeah so you ca fid me at stephsmith.io or o Twitter Steph smithio ad the yeah we're goa be hopefully lauchig the podcast soo the a16z podcast you ca fid it aywhere that you fid your podcast do you have a ame yet or or ot yet it's called the a16z podcast okay yeah sorry yeah all right all right uh thaks for comig o Steph ad uh best of luck with the Pod thaks [Music] foreig
